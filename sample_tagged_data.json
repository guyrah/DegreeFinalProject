This is newly remodeled with two drive-thru lanes, which is hilarious considering they were ten times faster when they had just one.  I have been here on about four separate occasions that I can remember, three being drive-thru, and I have (not exaggerating in the least) waited 10-15 minutes every single time.  Of these four times not once did I go during a peak busy hour and sometimes I was the only one in line.
