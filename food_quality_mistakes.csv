0,3,Ice coffe machine always broken| huge lineups all the time| but the employees are always patient and polite| so it makes the overall experience better.
0,3,It's an Arby's like any other Arby's...    staff's always been friendly and food's always been a good value.       The facility seems clean|  even if the interior's a bit dated - I don't go to a quick serve restaurant to be wowed by the ambiance.  ------I'm giving them 4 stars because as Arby's go|  they're fine.
0,1,I just go here for the confident girls that were fake tans| big boobs and little shorts really really well. Its a chill joint. very noisy food is big and fattening beer is ice cold. if you want fun and easy go here. its a chill bar but the crowd here is business men on lunch and tourists so people are cleaned up a bit. not a roll out of bed joint------I always get great service| they care about your driving ability after a few dirty blonde's (house beer) ------First impression is great everyone must go at least one and attended on at least one major holiday!
0,3,Terrible experience.  Was seated promptly and we sat at our table for 45 minutes without a one server coming to our table to take an order or even ask is how we were doing.  Had to walk up to the bar to get a beer and the place was half empty.  Had two beers without seeing a waitress at our table one time.  Truly dismal.  This place seems far more impressed by the temperature of their beer than they are with customer service.  Avoid at all costs.
0,1,Not impressed.  I have been here twice.  The first time was just me and a girlfriend.  We were just grabbing a drink before going to a movie.  It had been open maybe a month by that time and it was pretty full.  Of course there were mostly male customers| which is to be expected.  I will admit that many of the servers are attractive.  However| I wonder if they have little experience serving or just don't like female customers.  I'm a server| so I don't feel bad criticizing.  You're supposed to get the customer to come back and you also want them to tell their friends.  My friend and I did not feel like a priority for the server| she did not spend much time talking with us at all.  For all she knew| we could have money to burn| but because of the service| she gets a crappy tip.------The second time I went| my girlfriend and I both brought our significant others.  There wasn't that much of a difference.  Once again| we were just grabbing drinks before a movie.  Maybe due to the fact that we weren't ordering food or staying longer| she didn't feel that she needed to put more effort into her service.  If you ask me| that's when I| as a server| spend more time making sure that the customer's visit is a positive one.------The server spoke very softly and didn't seem confident and lacked personality.  I wonder what qualifications these girls need to get hired....24" waist and at least a "C" cup??------At a nearby table| we saw a male customer massaging the shoulders of one of the servers| which we thought was highly inappropriate| but the server obviously didn't mind at all.------There are short video bios of each of the girls on several of their tv's.  It's pretty cheesy.------Oh yeah| they don't do frozen margaritas.  What the french toast.
0,3,I hated being there. I saw the owner/manager yelling at the young server girl unnecessarily  and hated the disrespect. The food we ate was okay| but it used to be better when the place had different owners. The place had a fun funky vibe and okay food but now that there is so much hostility| I will find another place to spend $20 on an entry next time I am in Toronto. Too bad| another favourite off my list. Toronto is changing now that charm is being replaced by greed.
0,3,Welcome to the one man show.. :) Want a cheap eat?? you've come to the right place. This little whole in the wall is a perfect place for a simple burger. You defiantly can not go wrong. And for the price so much better then a chain hamburger spot.. $5 burgers and $2 potatoes.. I'm sold.. Great lil spot.. ---Check it out.
0,1,if i could give zero stars| i would. i have never in my life had more terrible service than i had here tonight. our server was jessica. and she was THE. FREAKING. WORST. we will never be back here again. this is unbelievable. i have never written a review like this before and i hate to bash local places| but clearly this girl cared about regulars/friends more than anyone else in the bar. the table next to us had 12-14 bottles on their table and we waited a half hour for our check. and she screwed it up. TWICE. ridiculous. get your crap together.------*edited for yelp as i didn't want to get deleted for swearing. see their facebook for a raunchier version...
0,3,Lets clear some stuff first... I love McDonalds...lol Its cheap and fills the tummy :D------This location here us a busy hot spot. The service is fast and the server are not rude. The seating is pretty nice| and they have a fish tank in the middle of the restaurant.------There is parking on the location and they have free Wifi.
0,3,I like this place a lot but the waitress was having a bad hair day and totally spoiled the meal. So sadly i have marked it down from four stars to three.
0,1,stay AWAY from this place| I overheard the owner of this place telling his employees to use up the rotten fruits and expired bubble tea powder first. Not to mention the owner| a short hong Kong man| was super rude to his employees. What's even more shocking was my friend said she saw employees trying to get rid a cockroach inside the kitchen while we were waiting for our drinks *vomits*. We through away the drinks as soon as we left the shop. Their drinks are especially good| so added with the gross experience| I'd rather take money elsewhere
0,1,Have you ever had the feeling like your wife might be slipped something while ordering a drink| or molested on the way to the can? That is how I felt while celebrating a birthday here. ------The place was down right creepy. ------Don't get me wrong| I love me a dive bar. I can eat on the curb in Mexico. I am a very trusting person. ------I hated this place. ------The drinks were ok| ther servers were not attentive| the decor and outside sitting area was cool.
0,1,Good service! even though me and a couple of coworkers came here late. The bartenders were friendly and told us what was the chill spots in town.
0,3,I'm all about Happy Hours and their specials. I am all about Martini's and a good martini at a low price. McDuffy's Grill has a great Wednesday "Three Olives Night" happy hour special. The staff is great| serving up the drinks the way you like 'em just for $3.99. What a steal!---The menu boasts typical bar fare. Not too many vegetarian friendly options but if you're looking for variety| don't eat at a bar! ---Overall| it's a good place for drink with friends| co-workers| or even going solo. I had to give it 3 stars because of the location and the entrance is so darn impossible to find!
0,1,The day I went in there| the guy did not really have too much of a variety.  Maybe he was waiting for stuff from SA.  Regardless| ho hum experience.  Nice owner| though.  Very friendly and polite.
0,3,I Came across this place randomly. I was looking to eat lunch  in this plaza. Great Indian joint very clean and stylish with a decent size buffet and good service /atmosphere. Prices are good too on all you can eat.  ---What makes me sad is that people who would pick burger king over this place ! ------Why not 5 star ? Cause I'm not Indian and I don't know what's missing to make it a 5 star------Will I come back? Heck ya
0,3,The lady at the counter was rude. Food portions are snack size. Hot rod theme that is a lame attempt at being cool. Nothing to brag about | which stinks because I like supporting independent food joints. This has been a disappointment 3 times in a row| you're out !
0,1,Standard Jack in the Box restaurant. I came here a couple weeks ago for a quick lunch stop. I walked in| stood at the counter| and waited roughly 10 minutes before I had my order taken. In the meantime| a line was forming behind me  The service was not very prompt; I waited an additional 8 minutes or so before I got my food. This is not a place to stop by if you're in a hurry or looking for fast service. Lesson learned.
0,3,Usually go to sushimon (the sister restaurant) but decided to give this one a chance| they have ramen with their AYCE and tuna cracker appetizers (spicy tuna on crisp rice) but food took a little long to come out and they forgot a few of our orders. I'll definitely come back| but will stick to being loyal to sushimon.
0,1,I was one of the party of 11 that went with another reviewer. I agree whole heartedly with the experience related by him. Rude waiter (clinton as noted in other reviews) SLOW service. I think they had 2 guys getting meat at a time. 5-10 minutes between skewers of which they would give a slice in the same amount as a slice of ham from a package for sandwiches in a grocery store. A slice from that package. Seriously| we got some alligator (after requesting it) and the size was like popcorn chicken from KFC| and I got 2 pieces.  For a 400+ plus bill| this was a very bad experience. ------Only thing good that night was the garlic beef and the bar (yesterdays| next door| not related to this place)  that saved the night for our group.
0,1,Ordered two pizzas Thursday on the website and received confirmation delivery number for 6:15 pm delivery. At 6:30pm my wife called to find out the status and was told that they never received the order. The owner| Mohammed| told me that the mix up wasn't his problem and that it was a head office problem. Extremely poor customer service and the fact he would not take responsibility and passed it off to "a head office problem" we will never order again from Mammas. If you can't get online ordering right in 2016 and don't empower you franchise owners to correct an issue on the spot you don't deserve my business.
0,3,Very cool place. The owner was super friendly and served our drinks quickly considering he was the only one there.------Cheap decor and furniture| the usual hipster-ish kind of set up I'm seeing a lot of lately.------Great booze selection and love the large menu clearly indicating what you can order and how much it costs. (Some  bars fail miserably at this). I liked the sound of the "whineing pomegranate" drink| although I wasn't up for trying it at 7pm on a Tuesday night. Maybe next time!------Hope the chef gets back from vacation soon so I can return to sample some food.
0,1,I liked this place| until I found hair in my sushi! Unacceptable!!!  Brought it up to the server| and was unresponsive| didn't even offer to take it off the check or anything. Very disappointed. Never going back!
0,3,Always a good time.  I've been here many times for football Sundays. ---Spacious| always room for big groups and super clean. Who doesn't love a clean bathroom.---Their name recently changed a lil'| but still kept the integrity of "Half Moon Sports Grill".
0,3,This is definitely one of their better locations. We come here for the salad bar whenever we want something a little healthier close to home. A quick tip| Ruby Tuesdays has a lot of options if you are trying to eat healthier. That was a pleasant surprise. Our waiter was fantastic. Keep it up!
0,3,Their other location on eglinton and tenth line is superior in quality| portions and service. However| this place is much better than most of the quick service Lebanese/shawarma places. Their portions are substantial!
0,1,Food... A LOT of food!---The first tim| we were lured here from watching an episode of man vs. food. Yup| we had the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Let's just say that the food won in this challenge. The second time I had the French Toast. It was just okay... The third time| the ginormous Chicken and Waffles. What a giant tower! I think I had only ate half.---Each time we came| the wait was pretty long for any parties larger than 4. I'm glad that more locations opened in Las Vegas over the years| so the wait is not as long any more.---If you think you are able to finish massive amounts of food like in these pictures| then this is the place for you! Or... sharing is caring: you can always share a plate ;)
0,1,If you like getting insulted by the bartenders for your beverage choices| then you could give this place 2 stars.  I switch to pop or water if I know I'm going to be leaving soon and need to lose the buzz| and you would think bartenders would be a little understanding of people not wanting to drink and drive.  Of course| the male bartenders wear shirts that say "Party like a pinata - get smashed" and the female workers hardly wear anything at all.  If you have a low IQ and/or high testosterone levels| then this is probably a good choice for you.  I will never return.
0,1,I am from the area and used to go to China Chef often. I decided to order takeout this evening for my family. I called and was immediately surprised by how rude the person answering the phone was. After trying to place my order the employee let out an exasperated sigh and said "oh my gosh". I was absolutely insulted. I have placed this order many times before. I quickly cancelled my order and hung up. Terrible customer service. They have lost a long time customer.
0,1,I wanted to try a new place downtown Phoenix and read some reviews and heard nothing but great things. I went on a cloudy night and probably about an hour before they closed. Not knowing what to expect I was asked if I wanted to sit outside or inside. I chose for outside since it was nice and cloudy outside. They had lights strung above the patio tied between the trees and lawn Wooden chairs. I order a darker beer and thought it was great but the waiter said he had a better beer if I loved the one I was drinking and brought me a free sample of another.  I had a great time and loved the open seating outside
0,3,I'm finally getting around to writing a review for Einstein. Had a craving for bagels and when I got there| no more bagels....was told that I needed to wait 20 minutes before the bagels were ready.  This was at 10 am.  I will not be returning to this Einstein.
0,3,super convenient for last minute grub. always open. never crowded.------go incognito-drunk and show up at 4am after the club.---then go again hungover 7 hours later with 10 family members for lunch.------win-win!------tips:---1. you already get all you can eat ban chan so dont' order the all you can eat meat dish. you are welcome to try| but you can nott eat up the whole restaurant. ---2. service is slow. ask to keep a pitcher of water at your table.
0,3,Service was ok| not super fast... Had Wifi hotspot at this tim Horton... Why 3 stars because there's no power outlet!!!! I mean hello???? Seriously? Starbucks is way more thoughtful than this...
0,3,This place was great! Colin| Larry and Christina were so helpful| attentive| sweet and gave the best recommendations on what to Order For us first timers. They delivered our sandwiches to our table right away and cleaned up as soon as they saw we were finished. Thank you for the great service! Will come back when back working in vegas! :)
0,1,Pt pubs is not tourist friendly| they are incredibly rude| bad service. One of our friends is visiting from UK and they did not accept his Identification. Declined our party of 15. The bar manager was extremely rude as well and just wanted us out. She didn't let us speak and blamed everything on corporate policy. We regulars but Never coming back to PTs pub.
0,1,Came here to sit in the evening sun and enjoy my dinner. Was here 5 minutes and they dropped the blinds and took the sun away. I mentioned it and they said they were closing them all for the people inside. Yet| more than just me sat out there for thr sun (only 72 right now) and people were getting sweaters out of their cars. We left. Went elsewhere to sit in the sun and eat dinner.------Second time here....still not impressed. Maybe if the bartender would have been nicer.......
0,1,Wait time is about 15 minutes for a full pizza so you can preorder online or by phoning ahead. They have pick up specials too!------There are a few stools where can eat and a couple of small tables inside.------When the weather is warmer| they'll have about 3 tables and 12 chairs for outdoor eating although you are beside Yonge Street so hopefully that just becomes white noise for you.------One thing I like about Pizza Nova is the bacon topping looks like cut bacon strips and not like it was a bacon sausage removed from the casing.------A popular place for quick meals south of Sheppard and on the eastside of Yonge.
0,1,Wow! Stingiest McDonald I have ever been. You have to beg for ketchup and napkins.  The staff here are not friendly at all.  They don't even know how to fake a smile.
0,3,Incompetent workers that I cannot believe want a raise for doing such a piss poor job. I knew I should've checked my very simple when the simple worker took it. Hijack SOB can't tell their asses from a hole in the ground. Will NEVER be back.
0,1,We sat down three guys came in after us they were immediately given menus and drinks. 10 mins went by and no one EVEN acknowledged us. Until we made our way out the door| thanking us for coming. Even thanking us for coming.
0,1,We had a pleasant experience here! A huge part of that was due in fact to our wonderful server Lisa. She really made us feel comfortable and we certainly enjoyed our meal and time there. I wouldn't expect any less of Mandalay Bay.------Bayside is slightly lower in price but the same vegas buffet staples are still there like crab legs which unfortunately were not warm and split open like other buffets prepare them. A bummer for my husband since he prefers them that way but a huge relief for me- I could ease my stresses of him from digging into this high cholesterol indulgence. ------Note: A wonderful alternative to the busy buffets along the main area of the strip- we were seated right away.
0,1,This used to be one of our favorite spots. It would always be busy so we would have to wait but the staff was friendly and worked quickly to get everyone in and out. We stopped here last night for dinner and should've walked out. The service was horrible. They were NOT busy and we still had to wait. No sense of urgency. Side conversations between workers. Guess we'll be finding a new spot. So disappointing.
0,1,I ordered breakfast here|  and the cashier got my order wrong|  I was dinning in and told him that |  but they gave me a to go bag. The soda machine was messed up|  every soda I choose was flat| not mention they were out of ketchup|  so plain hash brown for me and every other customer.  Stay away from this mcdonalds as I will.
0,1,Usually this is a go to spot once a month and I never have any issues but today's lunch was extremely disappointing ! The girl working clearly didn't want to be there today . She slops my herby turkey together annoyed | I asked for a pickle and she gives me one that's wilted and gross . I then asked for soup and she never got me the bagel bites to go with it .  Far from appetizing experience today .
0,1,This is the second time I have been here.  The first time| it was great.  Food was fabulous and the servers friendly. ... I decided to bring my husband.  After 10 minutes| I had ask for water and then we got a server.  It was not busy and the waitresses were just standing at the counter talking...Ugh!  Not so sure now that I will be back
0,3,Subs are good.  Reason I gave a 3 star is because I feel the customer service and time can step it up.  Second time I have been here and both times they are very slow at making the subs.  ------Tonight I walked in and order 3 subs.  I am the only customer in the joint.  4 employees working.  I place my order.  After I place my order| the cashier goes and sweeps|one gal starts to make the subs| another employee is cleaning the counter along the back wall and another is doing something else.  One would think that maybe another employee would stop what they were doing to help make 3 subs.  Nope| left it up to the girl and she was very slow.  A few other people walk in and order and then another employee starts on their subs.  Mind you| my order is still not complete.------I think I will stick with Subway next time.  More options| less expensive. Faster service and it still fills me up.
0,3,Was a nice authentic Chinese restaurant. Went for lunch and got busy really quick. Was a little confused because they don't seat us. You just sit down and then theyll give you water and menu. Price is good especially with the portion they give  you. People there are fairly nice.
0,3,Hands down one of the best Italian Restaurants in my hometown of Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is small and quaint. The atmosphere reminded my of a NYC restaurant. Staff is wonderful. Bartender made my wife a great dirty martini. I ate the Bolognese dish with an added meatball stuffed with cheese and my wife had the gnocchi. All pastas are homemade. Dessert topped off the night perfectly.
0,1,The little blurb when you select your star pretty much sums it up...Meh. I've experienced better. ------While the place is usually packed at breakfast time| the service is blah and the food is a bit pricey considering it's just IHOP. The healthy choices are limited and like I said...meh....whatever.
1,0,Came here with my boyfriend to watch the NBA Finals Game 1 and we ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork Nachos. They were below average and not what we expected. The many tvs made it easy to watch the game however.
1,3,What's all the hype about this place? This place sucks| I just don't understand how this place stays in business? it has to be some kind of money laundering business| who else would serve food like this? It's pretty disgusting. Flavorless tacos that are way out of line on price| nope never again| you'll never get my business again. The cashier thought I should be serving him|
1,0,Probably the worst service I have ever had. Very slow to get starters| and to get main courses. Veggie with chicken pasta EXTREMELY bitter. ---Brings birthday cake without candles and asks us to bring our own cake and candles next time| because they only carried one candle for the entire establishment. ---Excuses excuses excuses and arguing with customers| didn't even apologize and our server Ceara questioned us "have you ever worked at restaurants??".. Insinuating we don't know about customer service. This isn't the first restaurant we went to| and customer service was way better than this at every single other place.
1,3,American Chinese food. The schezuan style is not authentic here just as a heads up.  It's cooked in a tangy Americanized type suace instead of hot oil and red peppers. I've never had a curry taste so sticky/syrupy even with a coconut milk base. $16 for two small soft shell crab was kind of pricey in my opinion.------My waiter was clueless...wasn't very helpful or attentive. I was served a sushi roll of white tuna when I had asked for a sashimi dish as an appetizer.   He took it back| but I ended up waiting until after our dinner was done (30 minutes later) for me to tell him to cancel it altogether. Really disappointing.
1,0,I am repeating for this audience what I told the management when we were there. They need to educate their wait staff on how to properly serve simple dishes like moo shu. This dish| in my nearly 40 years of eating it| is always served on Mandarin pancakes and neatly folded and presented by the wait staff to the customer at the table side. I was offered a choice of pancakes or rice. I declined the rice. The filling and pancakes arrived without a bowl of hoisin sauce. I had to wait about 5 minutes for this to arrive before I could fold my own. Furthermore| my bowl of hot and sour soup was neither hot or sour. I mentioned this to our waiter and he brought me lemons and some pepper oil to season it to my taste. They did "comp" us for this bowl on nothing soup. Believe me| bland hot and sour soup just doesn't cut it. To their credit| the menu has many adventurous sounding dishes ranging from various Chinese regions to Thai and Vietnamese. Being from another corner of Cuyahoga county| we don't eat in Rocky River very often. We ate at Pearl of the Orient more than any other such place in that community and recall it to have been much better both in terms of the food and certainly the service. My wife is rather adamant that we won't be going there any time soon.
1,3,FOOD POISONING PROBABLE ---The service was great| but TWICE now the spicy tuna roll was not edible. When I told the server AGAIN the tuna was bad| she asked if I could come in on a Friday because that's when the fish is delivered...apparently they know it's inedible by Monday but still serve it. The owner never came out to address the issue and I was charged for the roll. Very disappointing and I fear for others. The last time I let the server know she still served a gentleman down the bar from me the same roll. Maybe the board of health needs to check into this .---To George: the server said your delivery day is Friday. She's very sweet and I appreciate her honesty. I wanted what I ordered| not a substitute due to the tuna being spoiled.
1,0,Poorly run and mean to their employees. Don't go here unless you want old| disgusting trash that will take 30 minutes to get to you. The food is also bad.
1,0,I went here today for food for the first time and I was disappointed. First| we waited far too long to be served| everyone else around us had service| but it took forever for someone to finally notice that no one had asked us if we wanted even a drink. Then I ordered a veggie wrap| with salad. When it came| I was given half salad| half fries| so I had to have it fixed. Then the salad was drenched in dressing| so much so that I had to blot it with my napkin. And my wrap was dripping with oil| again - blotting with my napkin. When I got the bill I was charged extra for the half and half fries| that I didn't ask for in the first place. Doubt I'll return.
1,0,Maybe because it was NYE but workers were friendly. It's connected to a convenience store that also has a few slots and a gas station too. There's a lot of cars going in and out of the parking lot.------In general I think Jack In The Box is decent but this location was slightly disappointing because the fries were not warm and soft when I received it...they were room temperature and kind of crunchy.
1,0,What can I say| my "Cafe aux Lait" has crummy drip coffee with steamed milk and it was disgusting. I don't think the barista knew how to use the espresso machine. I saw another patron return her coffee as well. The deserts were just average fair you would find behind the counter at a Loblaws bakery. We couldn't try the crepes because they were sold out 2 hours before closing on a Sunday.------Don't go even if you are really desperate. There is a Starbucks at the other end of the mall that serves average| but consistently OK lates and snacks.
1,3,Came here 3 times. ---First time I loved it| but next 2 times didn't. ------First off...please put a napkin in your bread basket!---Can anyone wipe clean the dusty border next to the tables?---You might wanna bring a sweater or hope to sit way in the back| away from the freezing entrance area (in winter) or away from the a.c. (in summer).------What about the food?------Large full plate! That's definitely great.------Half chicken with a salad (old lettuce)  with no dressing (?!) with some french fries. First time I ate these fries I thought these were the tastiest I had ever eaten.---But then| last 2 times they were not seasoned enough...------The chicken NEEDS a side bowl of sauce or it is quite boring.------Waitress seems out of place...portuguese resto?---At least they play portuguese music. ------Thought I had found a good place| but it's not consistant.------Again| I'll need to go back downtown|  to places like Doval's.------Being clean| consistent and fresh is very important in the restaurant business. ---This place just isn't.
1,0,Overall this experience was just average at best. The service was lackluster| the steaks were not cooked as ordered (one over done and one under done - both by far). The sides were fair| mashed potatoes were good| fries were ok| mac n cheese was below average. Dessert was a big disappointment (ice cream sandwiches). I honestly would find a different place to try next time.
1,0,I'm an oyster freak.  Yes| I'm talking about oysters| the food you actually eat and nothing else.  The thing is| I love oysters so I'm always looking for the best oysters in town.  I didn't like their oysters too much.  There seemed to be a very bad after taste to it.  My taste buds weren't too impressed.  For the price to pay| I wouldn't go back unless it's the last place where you can sit down and be served.
1,0,I ordered a soup from here and it was really small. I felt it was overpriced at $3.50 (if my memory serves me correctly)| considering it didn't come with a bread roll and I still felt hungry when I left. ------The owner is a nice guy and the coffee is pretty good but I found another place that sells coffee nearby and it's almost half the price and just as good - bearing in mind I am happy with a good cup of filtered coffee.
1,0,Skip this one| and go to the one up the road (Val Vista) near Home Depot.  Could be the same owners| for all I know.------This one is dirty and will screw up your order every time.  But they make up for it by serving it COLD!  They just don't care.------We've been there several times| as we live across the street.  (We get lazy and think| "Well| maybe they're better now."  Nope| still sucks.
1,0,Another unfortunate lunch experience! I just don't understand how on earth could they continue to be in business?  I had the brochette of beef| which comes with an imperial roll and some salad. There was no flavour whatsoever in the beef| and tough! I could have soled a shoe with it!! The fish sauce fell short as well Their soup is also forgettable.  The fried banana was the only edible thing we had. Take note| don't waste your money here.
1,0,Possibly not the cleanest place. I was violently ill after eating here| and I found out days after that a friend found a "worm" in her chicken bowl| i'm not sure how that happens| possibly in the lettuce?  but I would be careful.
1,0,This Burger King is selling undercooked burgers. I went there yesterday may 5| 2016 at about 6:30 pm and ordered a whopper and whopper Jr combo meals. The burgers were not even warm. Both my wife and I felt sick afterwards. I would check your burger before you leave this restaurant because they seem to rush your order and not cook the burgers completely.
1,3,Im so bummed!!! The Acai bowl is awful... not much acai blend... way too much granola (to the point where it was dry and i was basically eating only granola) also they chopped ONE strawberry and neatly placed it on top. They didnt have any honey drizzled on top (like most places do) or add different types of fresh fruits on top. I will never waste my money on this item again. Such a let down... I'll go a block away for my acai bowls
1,0,Consistently say we're never coming back but it is my son's favorite restaurant so we cave sometimes...... but tonight is just the worse. My son has acknowledged that he has to wait until he's an adult to come back! ---Food quality has changed| portion sizes are smaller and the service?! Omg the service is just awful. I come in with a smile and leave biting my tongue and cursing under my breath. ---How has this continued on for so long is beyond me. My suggestion? Go to the Olive Tree next door - you will be glad you did!
1,0,Its pretty cheap italian food. $20 bucks for a 3 course meal which is good.  quality..not so much.  There was a romaine heart in my cesar salad which is a no-no...also| got more of the inner| light green part of the romaine.  the cesar dressing was a bit overpowering.  The lasagne was average..nothing outstanding at all.  ------HOWEVER| the service was very good.  Waiter was funny and the staff was all friendly and accomodating.
1,3,I checked this place out today. Got one of their mini meals with Dhaal. Gosh - the dhaal was super salty. A definite "avoid at all cost" place for me!
1,0,Horrible service! Bad food! Guac is flavorless and chips are thick and do not compliment the guac texture. Asked for a margarita four times and it never came. Never returning'!!!
1,3,Somehow they decided it was okay to automatically autograt drinks and then below that add a line that says Tip! The only reason I noticed was because my two vodka sodas managed to be $25.30 here! My friend ordered some sushi and rock shrimp dish which he said was pretty good and I ordered the Teriyaki chicken which lacked any type of excitement. It was boiled chicken with a basic teryaki sauce- knda laughable considering the price!  Not sure if I'd come here for the food as the entetainment and dancing by the staff made for a better experience.
1,0,We've ordered from them for 3 yrs and they've gone from great to never again. Tonight"s pizza was burned and had no toppings whatsoever ever. Our super deluxe had no toppings! Too many other places to waste money on them.
1,0,My very first experience at one of Emeril's restaurants| and it was a decent one. Since my sis liked it the last time she visited| she decided it was worth another try. ------I have mixed feelings about this place------This restaurant had spectacular service| i have to admit. For our party of 6| felt like there was an army of servers| ready and awaiting our every need.  They were constantly refilling drinks and water and made sure we always had bread on our plate.  My napkin was folded when i came back from the restroom| which i always seem to use as a good measure of service. ------My favs were the country gumbo with steamed rice and the prime pork tenderloin.------As for the prime certified ribeye| I've definitely have had better.  ------Maybe worth another try? we'll see...
1,0,If you find that you simply MUST go here despite knowing in advance that the food is at best edible| at worst horrid and overpriced| and that the crap hanging from the ceilings is never cleaned although it zips mightily across the ceiling hovering over your plates| then there's nothing I can tell you to change your mind| is there??------The pound cake sundae is literally the only saving grace for this decrepit place.  You have been warned.
1,0,Terrible quality food.  Will never go back.  Taco salad had water at the bottom making the shell mushy.  Husband agreed that his meal was of low quality as well.
1,0,UGH!| I don't even know where to start. But I came for lunch around 11:45a and why| there was a nice welcome... well that was the end of it!. We sat down pretty quickly but it wasn't until around 12:10-12:15 when we finally got our drinks and finally placed our orders| in the end after having 3 waiters and having to stand up countless of time to ask about our food (chicken wings| Sandwich and a turkey wrap )| we finally received out food. Which included COLD! fries and under-cooked chicken wings. Needless to say I was completely disappointed with the experience| but I will DEFINITIVELY NOT return to this place.
1,0,Poor service and not prepared well.---That is the review ---Don't need to say much more---Sent steaks back 2 times.  ---And it is a steak place---Enough said
1,0,Love the other angry crab| but the mesa location is bad. Service isn't good| atmosphere is not like the other locations and the good doesn't taste the same. Avoid this location.
1,0,Worst meal I've had in years. The wait staff was attrocious - it took 30 minutes to get drinks and 45 for bread after we begged a bus boy. Then| all but one of the steaks we ordered came out over cooked. The chef and manager came by to apologize and replace the steaks| but then what they brought out was still wrong. With all of the great steak places in Vegas| I'd never go back there again. Especially with Mesa Grill right around the corner. We had lunch there and it was amazing.
1,0,Wish I'd seen the previous reviews. The burgers are mediocre at best. Mushy and not tasty. Ate a third and tossed the rest.  Service was alright :)
1,0,Subway is pretty hard to screw up| put some meat and veggies on fresh bread and you have a decent sub. I've only been to this location twice and I will avoid it after 2 bad experiences. The first time I tried it the bread was definitely not fresh. Much harder and drier than you would usually get at Subway. The second time they left the paper on cold cuts| pretty nasty surprise. I won't be back.
1,3,Another once-landmark that has now lost it's luster.  My biscuits and gravy was so bland it was pathetic.  The gravy tasted like paste and flour with no seasoning whatsoever.  Big portions of shitty food is still shitty food.  Trust me folks| this ain't the food that you see on the Food Network shows anymore!  It's gone way downhill in the past 3 years!  This was my last trip to HHAGG.
1,3,I am visiting in Toronto| staying next door to Ginza. Ordered food to go. Tom yum  soup with shrimp - vegetables where not fresh| and soup was tasteless. For the main dish I had seafood stir fried noodles. Again tasteless. It was so bad I am not going to give them a second chance.
1,0,Service was fanatic. This the reason for my two stars.  This place is run by Chinese and the quality of the fish isn't all that great.  I would only recommend if you're looking for deep fried stuff like tempura etc.  I wouldn't come back again personally
1,0,Just finished breakfast here. There are 4 customers here and our food took over 30 minutes to arrive. My order was wrong| they put the wrong veggies in my omelette. Hash browns are dry| generally uninspired breakfast. Save your money and eat at home.
1,0,Overpriced.------If you've been to Chipotle or Qdoba| then you know that this place isn't quite as good.  Maybe I was unlucky or maybe this co. needs to change their training procedure| but my bowl was a little on the skimpy side.  The person that helped me was clearly new since they asked the people around how much of veggies| beans| rice| meat| etc.  Because of that| mine was a little weak.------The chips are ultra-thin so feel especially oily.  I'll avoid Salsarita in the future--no need to tarnish the sterling brand that is Chipotle.------dmo out.
1,3,Zocalo gets points for having a tequila room (yes| a whole room full of tequila)| open-area seating| and a cool atmosphere. ------However| service was disappointing.  The place was not that busy but I still had to ask the bartender to close me out because the waitress was too busy talking to fellow servers to close me out.  ------If I had to describe the food in one word| it would be weird.  I ordered the veggie burrito bowl.  Cauliflower and broccoli--in Mexican food?  No thanks.  The dish was this weird amalgamation of not-so-complimentary flavors.  ------I will not be back for food| but I might consider going there for drinks.
1,3,I order  the meal| i asked for well done wings and got them regular| fries were soggy and could barely taste the sauce on it.  ---Wouldn't  waste my money on them again.
1,0,i just ate at steak and shake and let me just say one word grossssss! two thumbs wayyyy down get a better cook hello?! and the white chocolate milkshake tasted like crap!
1,0,Very disappointed!  Part of my meal was inedible and they didn't offer to even take that portion off my bill.  Over priced for what you get. I wish I had taken a picture. Charged me $2 just to put about 10 chocolate chips on my son's pancakes.  Usually I would give a place a second chance before I counted it out completely but I won't be going back here
1,3,Cheap and for a good reason.---A friend dragged me there a couple of weeks ago for a Sunday branch| 95% of the food was not fit for human consumption| The salad bar was the only salvation| service was below mediocre. I left hungry and wondered why the heck I drove all the way cross town to "dine" at this joint.
1,3,The Dude Abides - Really?  Did anyone actually take out the meatball and taste it?  My son said it was like a cheeseburger only harder to eat.------The Godfather was pretty good.  The bread with the Parmesan sprinkled on it made me think of the cafeteria food from grade school.------We both agreed that we should have gone to Chick-fil-a instead.
1,0,*** CAUTION FOOD POISONING ***---I ate here for the first time yesterday night (1/10/17) and I was super excited. I had garlic edamame| cucumber and avocado rolls| and an order of the spicy chicken. This is the LAST time I will ever eat here| as I have been violently throwing up all night/morning long since I got back home. My best bet is that the spicy chicken was not thoroughly cooked. I shared the dish with my boyfriend and he also got sick as well. Beware eating any chicken products here| or anything that requires cooking of any kind. I have never been so sick from something that came from a semi-upscale restaurant before. Never coming here again.
1,0,The yoghurts were definitely low in calories| however also tasteless...---Healthy can be tasty too. This was not the case unfortunately.------Also| my friend was given ice cream with a dirty testing spoon (meaning that this dirty spoon was first inserted into container full of ice cream waiting to be served to unsuspecting customers).------On the positive note| staff was friendly and polite.
1,0,Terrible pizza and terrible customer service.  If you want a dry tasteless and salty pizza order the Sicilian.  Manager was very rude when we asked for money back on this dry pizza.  I had a groupon to use and thought I would try this place but will never be back.---The employees are also rude and act unmotivated.  My advice.  Stay far away from this place if you want pizza.
1,0,This place is so hit & miss| you never know what and when you will get your order. It's been 44 minutes and still waiting for a take out pizza.------I've been here before and it has never been this slow. Looks like the same staff but I have no idea what's going on in the kitchen.------I left and went for Indian instead.------A meal later and I am back for that pickup pizza. What? Still not ready? You've got to be kidding!------It took an hour to get a take out pizza! ------The worst part was the very RUDE woman who said I should call ahead of time! Excellent idea. I will call ahead next time but for delved and NOT from San Francesco!------On another occasion the crust was so burnt| not even the dogs would touch it
1,3,Be warned if you order something like soulvaki it will take a bit longer since it is cooked fresh off the grill.  This place always has a line during the Taste of the Danforth festival.  Here they serve their gyros stuffed with fries (optional).  I came here for dinner - very busy.  Server was not very attentive during my visit.  Chicken soulvaki was a-okay.  My friend had the skewered shrimp.
1,0,Corporate mexican food? Kill me now!------On our most recent trip to Vegas| my gf and I were looking to get a quick bite and we saw this spot. Here goes;------The GOOD: The decor is nice| pretty spot. I think that's what wooed us. We sat at the bar| so we were waited by the bartender| nice guy. Quick service.------The BAD: The food. It's as bland as rice cakes. ------The UGLY: The fact that in such an amazing food city...we ended up here :(
1,0,The food is mediocre at best| they keep all of the doors open during the summer| the restrooms are a disaster and the beer could be a little colder. Fine for a bar...not so much for a restaurant. ---It was a mess behind the bar and my husband saw an employee leave the restroom without washing his hands.
1,0,Uhh... if you like cold eggs and bacon| this is definitely the place for you. ------The hashbrowns were not cooked thoroughly enough.  A bit under cooked. ------Prices? $23 for 2 basic dishes. Idk... is that  a good price  ya'll?  ------Anyways... im not interested
1,0,Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Was given a menu saying here are our lunch specials. We then try to order from the menu and they say that menu side we ordered from is only for the weekday but it wasn't even mentioned in person or on the menu itself. So we order the 'specials' anyway for regular price because it took long enough to have the waitress take our order in the first place. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich only to be told a few minutes later that they couldn't make those on the weekends? So I ordered the chicken fried chicken dinner. Yuck. The chicken was too well done| the corn was soggy and the potatoes had a weird taste probably due to the gravy. Will not be returning.
1,0,The biggest issue is that the food certainly is not fresh. Plus| there is too much of sodium and MSG. Enough| to upset your stomach. If you can ignore what you put in your mouth| this place might be for you. You are likely to be disappointed unless quantity and price is on top of our list..
3,0,The Curry Chicken Roti is my favourite dish. It comes with some tasty coleslaw and apple chutney. Coupled with some red stripes and you have a great meal.
3,0,Irie food Joint is a mix of traditional Jamaican Cuisine| with a twist of new world Queen St West flavor. ---The atmosphere is not typical of a Jamaican Pattie restaurant| there is comfortable seating| a garage door that opens up freely to the street| and soft grooves that keep the atmosphere relaxing.---The food is amazing| the staple roti's are available for dine in or take out| or try expanding your palette with some firecracker shrimp as an appetizer! There is one thing that is very reminiscent of the Jamaicans...SPICE! Be prepared to gulp down some milk when experiencing some of the hottest flavors in town.---Fair prices| and space to enjoy a small gathering or group make this restaurant a great choice for any dining experience.
3,0,Very good sandwiches| I have tried the turkey on pretzel bread and the roast beef on cibatta.  Good location| easy to get to off of Park  Ave.  There is a free parking deck out back and metered parking on South Blvd.  Outdoor seating is in the shade and the place was very clean and friendly.  Free WiFi is always a plus. Only 4 stars because it is a little pricey; sandwiches are between $7 & $8 and come with either a drink OR chips (other sides available)| so expect to pay $10.  Right now there are specials here on Yelp and also at Restaurant.com.  If I could have given 4 1/2 I would have. I would like to try breakfast but they don't open till 8am and i'm already at work.  Not many people in there when I went and I would like to see the place take off because I really liked it; the sandwiches are that good.
3,1,Always good food served by wonderful staff and Chris the manager. ------New specials everyday. Prices are great and portion sizes are usually big. ------Awesome place to get a bite before heading out of the Atlantic terminal.
3,0,These guys are awesome. I'm such a picky eater due to my food allergies| they are always so patient with me. They make everything perfect and always remember my weird orders.  Everything tastes amazing here| is decently priced| and the service is always exquisite!  Thanks so much Runway Cafe crew| I truly appreciate you!!!
3,1,I love this place! What a cute place to get a quick meal. My husband and I were in the area this weekend and needed to grab something for lunch. The outside of the building drew us in and I have to say| I'm hooked. If I lived anywhere near the area| I would definitely be a regular. I can't comment on the salads or chicken as the other reviewers have but| the pizza is delicious. My husband and I split a margherita pizza and got peach gelato from the attached market. The pizza tasted very authentic. Reminded me of our vacation to Rome and Florence.  The gelato was very flavorful as well and tasted of ripe peaches. To comment on the previous posts| there are two t.v.'s at the front of the restaurant which are hooked up to cameras in the kitchen so you can actually watch your meal being prepared. I watched the cook roll out my pizza| add topping and put it in the pizza oven. I also watched as she prepared salads and accepted money. Anytime that food was prepared| she put on a pair of gloves. The only downfall I see is the price of the dishes. Our pizza was $11 for a 10 inch pizza cut into 4 slices. The prices seem to reflect that of a restaurant not a small cafe/cucina. However| I would definitely suggest a stop for pizza and gelato if you are ever in the area.
3,0,The market-restaurant-cafe combo is very nice. My wife makes the Italian seven-fishes dinner for Christmas eve and the anchovies we got from the market were the best. I've had the sandwiches a few times and they are very good. The hot peppers are nice if you like a good kick in the taste buds. The only drawback is the limited menu.
3,0,Was out with the wife doing some fishing in Canonsburg & happened by this place. We decided to stop & have lunch. The first thing you notice is 2 long tables surrounded by chairs. Family style seating has never been a problem with me. Second thing I notice was a short line of people waiting to order & the line wasn't getting any shorter. I'm starting to think we've made a mistake.------Far from it. The reason for the wait was that everything is cooked to order. I had Uncle Sal's Famous Hot Sausage Sandwich. Best hot sausage sandwich I've ever had. Was told by an employee that Uncle Sal comes in every Wednesday to make the sausage by hand.------Also| there are cameras mounted so that you can watch your food being prepared on closed curcuit TV.------Can't wait to go back!
3,1,If I could eat at O-Ku for breakfast| lunch| and dinner I would be a very happy person. Oh. My. Goodness... best sushi I've had in Charlotte.------Ambiance and Atmosphere: Very trendy| a little dark| definitely a good date night or girls night out spot------Food: I ordered the spicy tuna crunch roll... delicious! The roll was pretty large and I would have been totally full if I had ordered 2 rolls. I also tried some of the mermaid roll (my friend ordered it) and another spicy tuna variation and both were delicious!------When to go: Mondays and Wednesday from 5:00-7:00pm (I think) are happy hour which includes half-price rolls. I recommend making a reservation if you want to avoid a wait during happy hour. ------Service: Zachary was our service and he was excellent the whole night. He was extremely friendly and checked in regularly to refill water and take more drink orders. ------Parking: They offer free valet parking| but I did not take advantage of this (I should have because the parking lot in Atherton where O-Ku is location does not have a lot of spots nearby). ------I will definitely be back!
3,1,After reading great reviews from the Charleston location| and a sushi spot opening close to me| I was looking forward to checking out the new spot.---I made reservations for four on Wednesday night at 6:15| after hearing they have 1/2 price sushi rolls from 5:00-7:00.---We arrived at 6:15 and were seated immediately| and noticed the place was not as crowded as I expected being its first week. Needless to say| I love the atmosphere| great decor| bar and a small sushi bar in the back corner.---We decided to start with the Dim Sum Platter| a mix of Shrimp Shumai and Pork Dumplings| served with ponzu sauce and sweet chili sauce. Both dumplings were good.---We ordered a variety| six| of the specially rolls. All were good| but what I recall from most of them is rice. The two that stood out were the Tuna Roll and Kiwi..yes| Kiwi. I was a little hesitant at first but it was great. The least impressive was the potato roll| one of their most famous. It honestly tasted like McDonalds Hashbrowns| never again.---I was also disappointed that they ran out of soft shell crab| by 6:30| so one of the rolls we wanted we could not try.---Prices are high and the drink menu is limited for wines and quite pricey. Not sure I would rush back| but did enjoy the atmosphere and may stop by for a drink or 1/2 price roll again.
3,1,Five stars all around| if u could give more I certainly would. ---First| the Valet guy was extremely nice and not only did he move cars but he held doors open and was funny and polite. ---Second| The ambiance is so nice| loud| and dark| it makes it comfy and a cute place for a date. I would just say| not a recommended child friendly restaurant; just because the place is tight and too loud and fast.---Third| the host was nice and pointed us to the bar right away because the house was full| but the bar did not disappoint. ---Fourth| menu is large and safe to say the mermaid roll was delicious| the seaweed salad was nice sized and yummy and the spicy edamame was addicting| the bar tender also hooked us up with some nice sushi| unfortunately I forgot what it was called.---Last but not least| the service was great| my drink remained full and my seaweed salad took a while to come out and they paid for it while also giving us some great sushi to try. Mark the bartender was extremely helpful| sweet and I would come back just for him! 10/10!! So happy it's in the neighborhood.
3,1,The best sushi in Charlotte! The staff from top to bottom truly care about your experience and will go out of their way to make sure you leave happy. The food is fresh and made with love. Definitely recommend the omakase (Chef's tasting menu) and the O-Ku nigiri!
3,1,The Lady and I had an absolutely awesome experience here. New Years Eve| we made call-ahead reservations that afternoon and arrived right on time (6:30). Easy to find on the side of Atherton Mill and easy to park as well| although they do offer a valet service. The ambiance oozes cool. Uplit branches| dark lighting| servers all in black| and few touches that say "Yea| I'm also a japanese restaurant too". Prices are on the high side| but not like..unreasonably high. Just not-every-week high.------Everything was to share| because that's how we do sushi. That's how everybody should do sushi. Our order:---Appetizer: O-Ku Spring Roll. Filled with fish and fresh veggies| and this sweet peanut sauce that I just wanted to pour on everything.---Rolls: Potato Roll. This was a really cool take on a fried roll| it had a fried potato 'crust' on the outside and well done fish on the inside. ---Mermaid Roll: Tempura fried and the only "warm" sushi on our plate| it melted in your mouth. ---Spider Roll: There's torched salmon on the top and that alone makes this roll worth it. Definitely would get again.---Yellowtail Hamachi: Laid on a basil pesto and had a thin slice of serrano pepper on top. This order will change depending on the quality of the fish| but ours...man. Awesome. This was good fish.------Our service was also excellent; our waitress explained everything in great detail as well as why certain things paired well with eachother. It was a pleasure eating at O-Ku and I can't wait to do it again.
3,0,The best sushi place in the QC!!!! ------I'm very picky about sushi and have found my new go to place. ------The customer service is on point and the atmosphere is spot on. ------It's a great place to grab a sushi roll| a drink with friends| or a whole meal!------I highly suggest truffle edamame| seaweed salad| white fish crudo (personal fav)| spring roll| miso soup| and the potato roll. ------I can't speak highly enough about the amazing culture| food| and friendliness of this restaurant. ------Kimball| you have brought the sushi scene in Charlotte to a whole new level. From one business owner to another| 6 out of 5 stars! Superb! ------Y'all won't want to miss out on this place! I promise you won't be disappointed and you won't find a better sushi place in the whole city!
3,0,Had lunch today and ordered the Meatloaf.  Fantastic.  Beer is ice cold.  Cassie waited on our table.  1st class service.  She is witty and beautiful also.  I'll be back.
3,0,Very surprised by the Greek Salad with grilled chicken. Good portion and the flavors between the kale| artichokes and capers etc worked very well. The local Kiltlifter is worth trying if you like Scottish style ales. Bartender Shey and manager Danny were attentive and took care of the patrons.
3,1,You had me at gyro!  I went to American Coney Island to try the dogs but decided on the gyro instead.  It was as good as those I've had at most greek restaurants.  I get it every time I go and still haven't tried their dogs.  I have tried the fries and they are very good.  The only negative is that their menu is basically dogs| gyros| fries| chili| and cheese so it might not please everyone.
3,1,Mess load of Nachos(carne asada) came jam packed with lots of toppings| meat| guacamole|cheese| beans and were a great deal for 7 bux. Carne Asada burrito for 5 bux was simple and tasty| not enormous| but def more than enough food. Don't expect a neat and clean restaraunt| as no one was cleanin tables| but hey its a taco joint so we weren't suprised.
3,0,The food was a little over-hyped for me but still pretty good. Our server on the other hand was outstanding! Strongly recommend this place as a higher class pub in Mississauga.
3,0,Came on a Saturday for lunch.  It was a nicely designed restaurant with and open kitchen.  The bar is lower level in a solarium which is quite nice.  Restaurant was empty except for another family.  It was expected| it is after all a beautiful warm Saturday afternoon in August.  We chose to sit at the bar to watch the Blue Jay game which they gladly switched from the Roger's Cup.  The bar tender was friendly and talkative without being interruptive.------Drinks:  Mojito| which bartender raved to be the best in the west end.  Certainly high up there.  2 glasses of chianti and a prosecco for the end of meal.  Prices were reasonable and comparable.------Food: Pulpo| duck poutine|  braised short ribs| Wilcox burger and Churros for dessert.  Prices were appropriate for the quality of food you are getting.    ------We plan to visit next time in the evening to see how the restaurant is.  This place is a gem in Mississauga.  The food definitely is a reason to return.  I'd like to see how the atmosphere is at night.  The service was good  considering by the time we left about 20 people were there and she was the only server.  She was quick and efficient and attentive.  We need more of these quality gastropubs in Mississauga.
3,0,Second visit here| this time at lunch with coworkers. The server suggested the shepherds pie and two of us took her advice. Delicious| homemade| generous portion and well-seasoned. Really satisfying. ------My other two coworkers had the chicken pot pie and Wilcox burger| both of which I've tried and reviewed. They were equally impressed.------Friendly| personable and attentive server. Great lunch!
3,1,Yay finally got to go to The Wilcox. Love the decor| the layout and design was very nice and the vibe is super chill. Food was pretty good! Veal bone marrow| so fatty but so good! Fish tacos was tasty and the fish and chips was on point| not too battered perfect amount of batter n fish. I'd definitely go here again!
3,1,First time and I was not disappointed. Amazing customer service| the food was amazing| fancy but casual; I would absolutely come back no doubt about it! The interior of the place is modern| with bits of nature which ties in all together. Can't wait to go back!
3,0,First of all! $1 Oysters? ---Amazing food quality and overall ambience| the servers were not pushy| extremely attentive| and always showed up at the right moments------We ordered a dozen oysters| the pulpo appetizer| chicken pot pie| and bread pudding to share between two people and could barely stand up by the end of the meal. It was a perfect mixture of gourmet and comfort food and we thought the prices were decent. Personally| would recommand the pulpo and the oysters (they are from PEI)------Will definitely return next time to try the burgers and the braised ribs (as suggested by our waitress)
3,0,As everyone already commented| which probably doesn't need another reiteration| the smoked meat sandwich is worth getting :)
3,0,If I could give this place 10 stars I would.  ------The ambiance is unique.  The food is classic. I hope this place never changes.  ------Totally worth this 5 hour drive to Montreal for schwartz.  ------Please expand to toronto!
3,0,Really good smoked meat| tender & tasty. Goes well with coleslaw.---Quick in & out meal.  Thumbs up so much!
3,0,There's a reason there's always a line in front of Schwartz's| it's because it's freaking amazing! The line is part of the experience| it's like you're going into a ride| a culinary ride.------Forget New York Pastrami| forget Lester's| forget you had to pick up the children at school| this is the only smoked meat you ever need to eat!------Service is more than good| it's fun| which is exactly what you want when going to this kind of place.------Better get a pickle!------This is Montreal at it's best! ------The reason I gave four stars instead of five is: "Calm your horses| it's only smoked meat!"
3,0,This is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Canada. They've been in the news lately with reports that the restaurant is for sale. If this is the case| I earnestly hope it remains in Canadian hands!------Having said that| I can add that the cozy atmosphere and wonderful aroma of smoked meat only adds to the appetite. Enjoy a smoked meet sandwich with French fries a cherry Coke| and save your diet for tomorrow! Schwartz's is an experience not to be missed.
3,1,The hype is real and food was ill - fuck with it heavy
3,0,I gotta say their smoked meat sandwich and pickle is delicious| sooo good.------However the place is shabby and small| often there's a lineup| and it's so warm in there that I question its sanitary condition :/ i see the dude cutting up the meat drenched in sweat... Doesn't reassure. Don't stare at the meat either| looks weird| greasy and just unappetizing if you're used to a lean clean diet.------If you like that dirty New York experience| go for it.
3,0,I stopped by here last year while visiting in Montreal. The guidebook I had highly recommended it and I wasn't disappointed in the least. My smoked sandwich was sumptuous and the fries were greasy but perfect. ---When I return to Montreal this will be on my to- do list!
3,0,We've been coming to The Pearl for more than a quarter century| so I figured it's time to post a review.------This is a favorite of our family. Food is always very good| portions are more than fair| and service is always friendly. Their pot stickers are the best we've had anywhere. Sushi is good too| but can be a bit slow to get to the table.------The owner is a great man who always visits tables to check on his customers.
3,0,I went to this restaurant with friends and loved it! The decor is classy and pretty| and service was great. Best of all| however| was the food! Yummy wonton soup| pot stickers| and sweet and sour chicken. The menu is huge so you can always find something new and delicious!
3,0,This is by far one of my favorite restaurants to get Asian food in the Cleveland area. I have never gone in here and had a bad experience. The service and the food is always outstanding and top notch. The servers are always extremely polite and vigilant. If you are looking for a great dinning experience I would recommend you go here!
3,1,We enjoyed a sold dinner here this week. Tried some sushi and a chicken dinner. Enjoyed wonton soup and split a non- noteworthy egg roll. ---Spicy tuna roll was delicious- lots of tuna and not overly mixed with spicy mayo or over-rocked. Will definitely go back for it since there is NO sushi in this area unless you count Heinens!!! ---The eel and cucumber was also delish. My hubs loves eel and he totally enjoyed this one. ---We split the bourbon chicken- it was nice but not really something notable. ---Overall I think this is a solid spot for sushi and I would give it another spin for sure. Service was great and the place was pretty busy on a weeknight. ---I also took into account the fact that they do specials! Love that and makes it a nice option for a weeknight dinner.
3,1,Review for sushi only.------Apparently| Pearl of the Orient has been serving sushi for several years. I don't eat much Chinese food (none| really) so I had no knowledge of this until my hair stylist mentioned it one day.------I went in on a Friday evening at 6pm-ish and sat at the bar. I ordered 2 sushi rolls (rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll) and they were prepared and in front of me immediately as the sushi chef wasn't busy. I devoured it like it was my last meal. I ordered a third roll (a Philly roll| I think) and it was in front of me in less than 2 minutes. The bartender| who was very attentive| suggested that it's hit or miss as to whether the sushi chef is really busy or not and whether you get your sushi quickly. ------I had zero complaints about the sushi. It wasn't gigantic| which is neither here nor there for me. I don't think giant pieces of sushi equals quality or deliciousness. My only comment was that the sushi seemed kind of warm and soft and fell apart somewhat easily (as opposed to cool and tightly packed| I guess). ------Now that I'm writing about sushi| I want it| so I'm sure I'll be returning soon. There aren't many (any?) options for sushi in Lakewood/Rocky River so I'll certainly check it out again soon.
3,1,Love the sushi... Little pricey but oh so worth it..There shrimp fried rice has plenty of large shrimp| my wife had chicken fried rice and loved it... The best thing that I would have to recommend is the desert... The Apple Ginger Eggroll is heavenly!!!   Especially the ice cream that comes with it.. will definitely eat here again..
3,0,The Ping gai dish is tasty| but service is really lacking.  Feels like the customer is a complete after thought or could depend on the server.  We just kept waiting or when she did come it wasn't pleasant.
3,0,Small portions| overpriced. Good flavour in the ping gai curry but it was mostly filled with noodles and nothing else| which is in no way enjoyable. Pad Thai had some good things happening| the sauce was flavourful but not very legit Thai.
3,0,Ping Gai - OMG!  One of the best tasting meals I've had in ages!!!  Recommended by our AirBNB hostess| we came here for dinner and left feeling like we are just let in on a huge secret:  eat here for the yummiest chicken in Canada!   Asian Fusion---mostly with an excellent steak & fries as back-up.  Food would be 6 stars. Weak drinks would be 4 stars.  So a five-star dinner!
3,0,Been coming here for years for the Ping Gai. Only thing I've ever had in the 20+ times I've been. Perfect every time. Wish I could make that dipping sauce at home mmm.------Love the place. A bit noisy and dark| so I only go when I'm in the mood for that.
3,1,The Queen Mother seems to have been around forever... and given that it's outlasted its namesake (there was a time when it seemed she was immortal)| it's nearly iconic in Toronto.  The Ping Gai is excellent.  It's all I ever have.  I have no idea what the other food is like.  I really don't care.------The cocktails are above average.  Certainly they know how to mix a Manhattan| though I've often found their Gin and Tonics flat and too weak for my tastes.  ------I've been served by the same person the last three visits and she's absolutely charming.  Most attentive and almost seems to care that you enjoy your experience.
3,1,I've always wanted to eat at Queen Mother Cafe| but usually I'm distracted by sushi (Ematei) nearby. But a friend decided she did not want sushi for lunch| under any circumstances. So| QMC it was!------I loved it the moment I stepped inside. It's funky and eclectic| with lots of nods to the monarchy in the decor. I admit| I'm a sucker for the fascinating and the historical. ------And| mmm| the food! I was really happy with my khao soi (beautiful coconut broth| spiced to perfection| with chicken| thin noodles| picked veg| mint and lots of coriander). I wish the noodles were thicker| but that is being picky. The flavours were extraordinarily well matched| and my yummy was happy.------So glad I finally made it here; I will be a repeat visitor fo sho.
3,0,Just want to say that the outdoor garden seating was very nice. We especially enjoyed the calamari. We thought the sauce that came with our Laotian egg rolls was the better sauce for the calamari than the one they came with. Personal taste perhaps. Laotian egg rolls were great as well. Quinoa salad was very tasty. We really enjoyed the place.
3,0,Surprisingly good...for the most part a 25-35 crowd.  Shared the PING GAI chicken and the QUINOA SALAD and they were both very good. The PING GAI chicken had a good amount of chicken (enough for both of us) and overall| meal| tax and tip for about $45 (1 beer and 1 tea). They also have a nice selection of desserts which we did not try.  The seating is a little tight in some areas and the lighting is very bright which creates a nice cozzy atmosphere
3,1,This was a delicious experience. I got the cannelloni| green salad| earl grey tea and banana chocolate cake. My friend got one of their popular chicken dishes with a huge serving of chicken considering the price and quality. Our service was great| although there was constant bickering and tension amongst the staff throughout our meal that made the atmosphere slightly uncomfortable. One of the staff members| who wasn't our server| was pretty rude to us. We think he was the owner| but we're not certain. However| the constant atmosphere provided by the big comfy booths| local art| candles and low lighting made this a good experience. It was a bit of a pain that they didn't have debit| but that seems to be a constant issue in many restaurants these days.
3,0,My wife and I just happen to stumble upon this place and man it was great! Family owned business and they make you feel at home. I had their white rice and beans with the fried plantains| my wife had their chicken. The meat just fell right off the bone. Bring your appetite because the portions are heavy! She loved it! I live in Gilbert and now we're regulars at FrinGos kitchen.
3,0,I dont know how someone can write an entirely positive review and still give only a 3 stars. This place is amazeballs. The specials are cheaper than the elgin mills location that is closer to me. The cornmeal on the pizza bottom is soooooo guuuuuuuud. Wings are just delish| they toss it in sauce after theyre ready. The bacon honey mustard sauce is *high pitched voice* to diiiiieeee for. They are smaller wings but meat is always juicy and skin is flavourful. Marinara sauce is $1 and is a GENEROUS portion. Wait time is less than pizza pizza too. No seating| take out only.
3,0,This small unassuming takeaway (there is a dining space however there are no facilities) produces some tasty Indian food and the portions are generous. I particularly like the tandoori chicken biryani (the chicken in this is cooked fresh when you order)| though the curries are also flavorful| if fairly standard Indian fair.------In the area you can't go far wrong with Taj Express| the food is tasty and there is plenty of it.
3,1,maybe it's because the gelato shop by me closed and i had been craving gelato for a good month when i stumbled across this place.  maybe it's because i was just thinking of the delight in my son's eyes when i would surprise him by bringing his favorite tasty treat.  whatever the reason| i LOVED this place.  there are a few cozy places to sit and the service was fantastic!  i was offered samples of anything i would like to try| but i already had my favorite picked (mango) and it was delicious.  i've never had gelato i didn't like| but what made this place stand out was definitely the genuine and friendly service.
