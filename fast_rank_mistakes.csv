0,3,On our way to a stroll around Freedom Park| we realized that we were hungry for lunch.  Armed with a plethora of restaurant.com gift certificates| Quips was a convenient choice.------The first thing you notice is that the place is basically an upscale sandwich shop. (think Subway| Quizno's| et al).  The guy behind the counter was fabulous.  He told us about the menu| and we decided on the roast beef (#1 Clever) and turkey (#2 Witty).------Both were served on ciabatta bread| and both were pretty good.  I guess if I had an issue| it would be in the pricing.  In a world of $5 foot-longs| I'm just not sure if I liked the fare 50-60% more.
0,3,It was pretty much what I expected - high end ambiance to justify outrageous prices.  I knew this ahead of time so I waited until I had an opportunity to host a work dinner.  So this week I had a customer come to town and took him and my partner.  We went early (~5:30) because we were going to a hornets game afterwards.  I assumed I wouldn't need a reservation at that early hour but when we arrived the hostess said she could only seat us at the sushi bar.  I called her bluff and said we'd go somewhere else and the manager who happened to be standing next to her seated us at a table.  We ordered a some apps| which were good but teeny tiny| and the sushi was fine but I don't think I could take a pepsi challenge against any other sushi place in town if you took off the fancy presentation.  As expected with cocktails| sake| wine| and 3 hungry diners the bill was astronomical (and the rolls were half off!).  If you're looking to keep costs down stay away from the nigiri.  I'm not a sucker for high end experience and prefer a more casual environment.  Ru-san's is my favorite in Charlotte and I'd go there over this place any time.
0,3,If you're wondering why this place is packed on a Saturday night| it's not because the place is trendy| or that the staff is super friendly| or that it just opened. While all of this holds true| it's simply because the food is outstanding. This place is the definition of #WorthTheWait.------And is it really waiting if you're sipping on some drinks? Check in| give the hostess your name| and head over to their convenient bar with a staff that knows how to burn a drink. Relax| enjoy the ambiance| and let your cocktail ease that hangriness out of your system while you wait for your exceptional dinner.------We had the cracked shrimp appetizer which might of been my favorite appetizer I've ever had at an Asian restaurant. I don't even like sashimi but we tried it anyway| and guess what? It was delicious. Top it all of the sushi was prepared fresh and we finished every bite. If you're looking for some great Asian cuisine| look no further; O-Ku is your spot.
0,1,If I could eat at O-Ku for breakfast| lunch| and dinner I would be a very happy person. Oh. My. Goodness... best sushi I've had in Charlotte.------Ambiance and Atmosphere: Very trendy| a little dark| definitely a good date night or girls night out spot------Food: I ordered the spicy tuna crunch roll... delicious! The roll was pretty large and I would have been totally full if I had ordered 2 rolls. I also tried some of the mermaid roll (my friend ordered it) and another spicy tuna variation and both were delicious!------When to go: Mondays and Wednesday from 5:00-7:00pm (I think) are happy hour which includes half-price rolls. I recommend making a reservation if you want to avoid a wait during happy hour. ------Service: Zachary was our service and he was excellent the whole night. He was extremely friendly and checked in regularly to refill water and take more drink orders. ------Parking: They offer free valet parking| but I did not take advantage of this (I should have because the parking lot in Atherton where O-Ku is location does not have a lot of spots nearby). ------I will definitely be back!
0,1,Sweetie and I wanted to try something different for our anniversary and we like sushi| so why not go and see what all the fuss is about?------I made a reservation on OpenTable for a Friday night| 6:30 so I didn't have to wait in the line that was sure to be formed by then and off we go.  I got the obligatory reminder call on Friday afternoon by a pleasant lady which is always a nice touch.------We showed up and they had free valet parking which is a nice touch since nothing is worse than parking your own car and having to find a spot at a hot| new restaurant where everyone else is.  Walked in to a nicely decorated| well thought out space.  So dark I had to use my cell flashlight for the menu.  Nice music playing and servers were plentiful.  We got a nice hightop near the front door which was a nice table to start but as the restaurants filled up the overflow from the bar with people waiting for seats got a bit annoying as I really could care less about the guy this lady picked up on Tinder but was forced to listen to because she stood right near my table.------Our server was nice| attentive and was good at what he did.  I'm not a drinker so I usually order Iced Tea and come to find out they don't have Iced Tea on the menu.  WTF?  This is an outrage| all "sushi places" have Iced Tea.  Besides| this place originated in Charleston SC| the birthplace of Iced Tea and they're in the south for crying out loud.  This must change| now.  Anyway| I sipped on Charlotte's finest tap water instead.  ------Appetizer was the O-Ku Spring Roll which I highly recommend.  Nice selection of fish| some wonton crisps for added crunch and an outstanding sesame sauce for dipping.  Well done!  I grade a sushi place by the innovative specialty rolls and frankly O-Ku needs to beef it up| they only have about dozen on the menu and not too many standouts.  We had a Rainbow| Kiwi Kani| and Mermaid.  The Kiwi Kani fit the bill of innovative| and was delicious| the addition of the fresh kiwi made the roll and it was wonderful.  Dare I say one of the best rolls in the Queen City.  I noticed on the menu that they had fresh wasabi| not the green dyed horseradish that most have.  Come to find out they were out.  Here we go again| no Tea and no fresh wasabi?  Our Server suggested the pickled wasabi instead which was different and I must say| excellent.  Added a different dimension to the meal.  We finished with an almond cake or something and it was a nice cap to the meal.------I liked O-Ku.  They're still new but if you're looking for a new "See and be seen" place this is it.  Nicely done place with good food.
0,1,Great food. Excellent service. Sexy atmosphere. ------We went on a Monday night for a birthday dinner. When we walked in my initial thoughts were| this place is sexy AND it is WAY too loud in here to be half full. ------The hostess repeatedly asked us a ton of questions because she could barely hear us despite the fact that we were standing directly in front of her. They asked a TON of questions before seating us| including our phone number. Not sure why they needed all the info as we didn't have a reservation and didn't need to wait for a table. ------Our server was excellent. Her name is Linda. We found out at the end of the night that she was in training| but she did a great job. ------We had two sushi rolls: the mermaid roll and the kiwi-kani roll. The kiwi roll was fantastic. It was full of blue crab| tightly rolled| and had a sweet and salty balance I love. ------We also had the curry duck. We were expecting a Thai type of entree with a large amount of sauce. Instead| it was a sliced breast with a curry marinade and some awesome eggplant. Recommend. ------TL; DR: get the kiwi roll. Sit in Linda's section. Enjoy if you can hear your table mates.
0,3,Wow what a pleasant surprise. Just moved to Charlotte this afternoon and decided to walk outside and grab a quick dinner when we stumbled into the soft opening of O-Ku. The wine pairing was great and slightly unusual in that we had South African and Oregon wines that were crisp| different (from the usual standards)| and delicious. We split Spicy Edamame (yummy but not markedly unusual)| Ceviche Tacos ( nice presentation and very flavorful)| and Miso soup. For the main course we had the Mermaid Roll (fresh with a new twist)| Potato Roll (the winner of the evening!!)| and Curry Duck (large portion cooked perfectly with unusual type of eggplant). The service was excellent from the hostess| server Megan| and manager Justin. The ambiance was very nice in such an old eclectic building and the indirect lighting and lighting fixtures really set the tone for a cozy evening. They plan on having half price sushi happy hours Monday and Wednesday and we definitely plan on returning.  What a great evening. So happy to know that we can walk outside Ashton South End and enjoy such a nice (and healthy) evening. Thank you O-Ku!
0,3,I wish I could comment on the food but we could not make it past the pretentious staff! They lie about the wait times and give preferred service and entry to friends or better looking people. They were rude to my date and insulted her.  Thank you O-Ku Sushi for embarrassing me and ruining my night before it even got started unless you're a hipster douchebag good luck even getting seated we never did. i would not recommend this place to me enemies.
0,1,I just go here for the confident girls that were fake tans| big boobs and little shorts really really well. Its a chill joint. very noisy food is big and fattening beer is ice cold. if you want fun and easy go here. its a chill bar but the crowd here is business men on lunch and tourists so people are cleaned up a bit. not a roll out of bed joint------I always get great service| they care about your driving ability after a few dirty blonde's (house beer) ------First impression is great everyone must go at least one and attended on at least one major holiday!
0,3,Great lunch. Thanks Angie for your great service. Good food and tons of TV's to watch the game. Look forward to coming back again.
0,1,Not impressed.  I have been here twice.  The first time was just me and a girlfriend.  We were just grabbing a drink before going to a movie.  It had been open maybe a month by that time and it was pretty full.  Of course there were mostly male customers| which is to be expected.  I will admit that many of the servers are attractive.  However| I wonder if they have little experience serving or just don't like female customers.  I'm a server| so I don't feel bad criticizing.  You're supposed to get the customer to come back and you also want them to tell their friends.  My friend and I did not feel like a priority for the server| she did not spend much time talking with us at all.  For all she knew| we could have money to burn| but because of the service| she gets a crappy tip.------The second time I went| my girlfriend and I both brought our significant others.  There wasn't that much of a difference.  Once again| we were just grabbing drinks before a movie.  Maybe due to the fact that we weren't ordering food or staying longer| she didn't feel that she needed to put more effort into her service.  If you ask me| that's when I| as a server| spend more time making sure that the customer's visit is a positive one.------The server spoke very softly and didn't seem confident and lacked personality.  I wonder what qualifications these girls need to get hired....24" waist and at least a "C" cup??------At a nearby table| we saw a male customer massaging the shoulders of one of the servers| which we thought was highly inappropriate| but the server obviously didn't mind at all.------There are short video bios of each of the girls on several of their tv's.  It's pretty cheesy.------Oh yeah| they don't do frozen margaritas.  What the french toast.
0,3,Mess load of Nachos(carne asada) came jam packed with lots of toppings| meat| guacamole|cheese| beans and were a great deal for 7 bux. Carne Asada burrito for 5 bux was simple and tasty| not enormous| but def more than enough food. Don't expect a neat and clean restaraunt| as no one was cleanin tables| but hey its a taco joint so we weren't suprised.
0,3,Came on a Saturday for lunch.  It was a nicely designed restaurant with and open kitchen.  The bar is lower level in a solarium which is quite nice.  Restaurant was empty except for another family.  It was expected| it is after all a beautiful warm Saturday afternoon in August.  We chose to sit at the bar to watch the Blue Jay game which they gladly switched from the Roger's Cup.  The bar tender was friendly and talkative without being interruptive.------Drinks:  Mojito| which bartender raved to be the best in the west end.  Certainly high up there.  2 glasses of chianti and a prosecco for the end of meal.  Prices were reasonable and comparable.------Food: Pulpo| duck poutine|  braised short ribs| Wilcox burger and Churros for dessert.  Prices were appropriate for the quality of food you are getting.    ------We plan to visit next time in the evening to see how the restaurant is.  This place is a gem in Mississauga.  The food definitely is a reason to return.  I'd like to see how the atmosphere is at night.  The service was good  considering by the time we left about 20 people were there and she was the only server.  She was quick and efficient and attentive.  We need more of these quality gastropubs in Mississauga.
0,1,Pearl of the Orient in Rocky River is| to me| the best Chinese in Cleveland. I have been eating here since 1992 and I continue to love it! The Yuen Baos (wonton wrappers stuffed with cream cheese| crab and shrimp| then deep fried) are heavenly!! This visit we had the mu shu medley| house noodles| string beans in garlic sauce and orange chicken. All delicious!! The owners| George and Lily| are top notch as well. I love the Pearl. It is often voted one of Cleveland's best Chinese restaurants and I can definitely see why. I can't wait to return.
1,0,OMG... talk about bait and switch...------They build a whole new building and cut both the staff and the hours!------They don't know what to do with 2 ordering lanes... we have given up and started going to Steels Corner... such a shame!!
1,3,Slowest.......McDonald's........ever.  Do not| I repeat| DO NOT come here if you think you're going to just waltz through here on your way to work.  You'll be better off stopping at the farm to pick up your ham| eggs| and cheese to make your own McMuffin.  This is newly remodeled with two drive-thru lanes| which is hilarious considering they were ten times faster when they had just one.  I have been here on about four separate occasions that I can remember| three being drive-thru| and I have (not exaggerating in the least) waited 10-15 minutes every single time.  Of these four times not once did I go during a peak busy hour and sometimes I was the only one in line.  Not sure what they're doing in there but it definitely isn't fast...
1,3,Lack of service at the bar. It took us 15 minutes to take bartender attention. Wines are over price.---And their food is ok.
1,0,I understand I'm not dude and so I'm not there to stare at your "twin peaks" however| that being said I am there to buy a beer and when it takes the bartender 20 minutes just to get a beer I'm over it. So I was never gonna come back but was forced with a group of friends who wanted to eat and was just as upset as the first time. Fries were soggy and our server disappeared. We all decided were not going back. Just because your a good looking server doesn't give you an excuse for sucking.
1,3,When I got to the place i was given a table for 4 but i had 6 people with me and to order our food it took about 45 min to an hour---Ordering drinks was quiet fast but food service was extremely slow.---the menu looked amazing and i was excited to try the food especially the duck confi wings and sliders.---After waiting about 45 min to an hour we finally got our food and it was extremely under seasoned the food lacked taste| it was almost bland| hopefully they fix it because i was extremely disappointed paying 20 dollars for one meal and receiving something that tasted like cardboard.---I do not recommend this place.---over priced for low end food with fancy names
1,0,If you're a foodie and find yourself in Montreal| make sure you find yourself at Schwartz's.------The line for sit down is long| but the line for take out is short and since it's all about the food| that's what you'll do! ------I got a smoked meat sandwich and the smoked meat poutine. Wow| is that meat delicious! The sandwich competes with anything you'd get at a NY deli. That's a huge compliment from a snob like me. And the poutine OMG the poutine| this thing is an attack of yummy. I live in Wisconsin and certify that those cheese curds are as fresh and squeaky as they come. Combined that with meat| fries and gravy and you have yourself a bowl of heaven!
1,0,There's a reason there's always a line in front of Schwartz's| it's because it's freaking amazing! The line is part of the experience| it's like you're going into a ride| a culinary ride.------Forget New York Pastrami| forget Lester's| forget you had to pick up the children at school| this is the only smoked meat you ever need to eat!------Service is more than good| it's fun| which is exactly what you want when going to this kind of place.------Better get a pickle!------This is Montreal at it's best! ------The reason I gave four stars instead of five is: "Calm your horses| it's only smoked meat!"
1,3,I think if you're to go to any restaurant in Montreal to get a taste of the city you need to go to Schwartz's. I remember coming here a while back during the day time and having a fantasticly huge smoked meat sandwich. Thankfully| one of the best things about Schwartz's is that you can get yourself one of these bad boys at pretty much any time of day. So when I needed my midnight snack I knew I had to come here. ------Ok first of all I don't even like smoked meat. Except here| of course. Anywhere else I can't do it. So I ordered 2 medium smoked meat sandwiches| 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 half sours. Sadly they were out of half sours so I ordered a regular pickle.Despite there being a line (even at 12AM)| the service was polite and efficient. Just a reminder| these guys are cash only| but theres an ATM in the back. For the 4 sandwiches+pickle it came to $36| pricey I guess| but totally worth it. I realized I forgot my cherry coke on the way out which was plain silly.------The meat was a bit dry. It wasn't moist and delicious like the first time I had it| perhaps because it was at night? Perhaps there was more fat on it the first time? Either way| it was still so huge it was nearly impossible to eat| and the amazing spices were all there so it still tasted great.  The pickle was also great| if you haven't had a pickle that isn't from a jar you bought at the grocery store| you need to. I don't know why they're so much better but they are. The turkey was also exceptionally good| but it was a cold cut| still it was seasoned wonderfully and also nearly impossible to eat like the smoked meat one. Also they threw in a few extra pickles for me! Yay-------1 point for the meat being dry. I'm sure it was an isolated incident ! :) Can't wait to be back.
1,0,I gotta say their smoked meat sandwich and pickle is delicious| sooo good.------However the place is shabby and small| often there's a lineup| and it's so warm in there that I question its sanitary condition :/ i see the dude cutting up the meat drenched in sweat... Doesn't reassure. Don't stare at the meat either| looks weird| greasy and just unappetizing if you're used to a lean clean diet.------If you like that dirty New York experience| go for it.
1,0,We have come in to Pearl of the Orient multiple times. The reason I give it three stars is because it is always a bit different because of who ever is cooking in the back. Some of the cooks are better then the others. ------The food is delicious| the sushi is great (takes a little long to make so be ready to wait) and the main dishes are large enough to share. ------The service is very nice and everyone is helpful explaining things on the menu. It is a quitter atmosphere and I rarely see the bar completely filled but if you want some good Chinese| then this is definitely better then any takeout you have had.
1,0,American Chinese food. The schezuan style is not authentic here just as a heads up.  It's cooked in a tangy Americanized type suace instead of hot oil and red peppers. I've never had a curry taste so sticky/syrupy even with a coconut milk base. $16 for two small soft shell crab was kind of pricey in my opinion.------My waiter was clueless...wasn't very helpful or attentive. I was served a sushi roll of white tuna when I had asked for a sashimi dish as an appetizer.   He took it back| but I ended up waiting until after our dinner was done (30 minutes later) for me to tell him to cancel it altogether. Really disappointing.
1,3,Poorly run and mean to their employees. Don't go here unless you want old| disgusting trash that will take 30 minutes to get to you. The food is also bad.
1,0,A stand by in my group of friends for bday celebrations.  Yes| the tables are squished together and it does get noisy.  And I have waited for a table almost everytime I have come here. However| they have a great patio and excellent food.  Love| love| love the ping gai chicken and the steak is delicious too.  For lunch I recommend the burger.  The portions are huge.
1,0,I went here today for food for the first time and I was disappointed. First| we waited far too long to be served| everyone else around us had service| but it took forever for someone to finally notice that no one had asked us if we wanted even a drink. Then I ordered a veggie wrap| with salad. When it came| I was given half salad| half fries| so I had to have it fixed. Then the salad was drenched in dressing| so much so that I had to blot it with my napkin. And my wrap was dripping with oil| again - blotting with my napkin. When I got the bill I was charged extra for the half and half fries| that I didn't ask for in the first place. Doubt I'll return.
1,0,This is my favorite local pizza place in all of Pittsburgh. The Sicilian is excellent| although it does take a bit of time to get to your table because of baking time.------Other menu items worth checking out are the grispelli (not sure that I spelled that right)| the salads| and the hoagies. Really| you can't go wrong.------The dining area is very small (8 tables or so)| but outdoor seating is available when the weather is right.
1,3,Standard Jack in the Box restaurant. I came here a couple weeks ago for a quick lunch stop. I walked in| stood at the counter| and waited roughly 10 minutes before I had my order taken. In the meantime| a line was forming behind me  The service was not very prompt; I waited an additional 8 minutes or so before I got my food. This is not a place to stop by if you're in a hurry or looking for fast service. Lesson learned.
1,0,Food was great! It is a cash only place so hit the ATM before you get there. They took a bit to take our order but it was busy.
1,3,Usually go to sushimon (the sister restaurant) but decided to give this one a chance| they have ramen with their AYCE and tuna cracker appetizers (spicy tuna on crisp rice) but food took a little long to come out and they forgot a few of our orders. I'll definitely come back| but will stick to being loyal to sushimon.
1,3,First time here last Friday for late drinks and food. We had a reservation for 8| our table wasn't ready (lingering group of people who just wouldn't leave...) but the staff handled it really well. They made a make shift seating area for our group and comped us some drinks while we muched on the pad thai fries. Various wait staff (and manager?) apologized for the delay and our server kept checking in with us. Eventually the group that had overstayed their welcome left and we got our table. I really have to thank the staff for treating us so nicely. Most places would just say "tough luck| it's a Friday". Food was on the spicy side| but there are a few less spicy options.
1,0,Normally I enjoy ordering from here| however this particular evening| it took an hour and a half to deliver| my food was cold| and parts of it burned| and they forgot my salads| which is where they put the little dish of tzatziki in| so I had to eat dry| burned chicken. ---On top of that| it took an hour for them to deliver the salads again. ---After paying $35.00 for 2 meals| and a good tip to the idiot delivery guy| not impressed.---And on top of all that| no one at the restaurant apologized| neither did the delivery guy. Really disappointing.
1,3,UGH!| I don't even know where to start. But I came for lunch around 11:45a and why| there was a nice welcome... well that was the end of it!. We sat down pretty quickly but it wasn't until around 12:10-12:15 when we finally got our drinks and finally placed our orders| in the end after having 3 waiters and having to stand up countless of time to ask about our food (chicken wings| Sandwich and a turkey wrap )| we finally received out food. Which included COLD! fries and under-cooked chicken wings. Needless to say I was completely disappointed with the experience| but I will DEFINITIVELY NOT return to this place.
1,0,Ordered two pizzas Thursday on the website and received confirmation delivery number for 6:15 pm delivery. At 6:30pm my wife called to find out the status and was told that they never received the order. The owner| Mohammed| told me that the mix up wasn't his problem and that it was a head office problem. Extremely poor customer service and the fact he would not take responsibility and passed it off to "a head office problem" we will never order again from Mammas. If you can't get online ordering right in 2016 and don't empower you franchise owners to correct an issue on the spot you don't deserve my business.
1,3,Excellent food and service every time. All the hype is well-deserved and the serving are HUGE. The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the usual wait on the weekends.
1,0,It's a cool looking place but the crowd was very random. From dressy to gym shorts the atmosphere was off for me. Service wasn't great| brought our appetizers with our main meals and we had no room on our table. Had to use the ledge next to the table for the dishes. Our waitress took forever clearing the plates and we were given two bills by two different staff members. Given all that the food was average.
1,3,After reading the reviews and then stopping by for the seafood po'boy| I can confirm how wonderful this place is. As most reviewers have noted: the food is made to order| which is slow but fresh and worth the wait. Another selling point was the conversation and general friendliness that the owner provided. One last thing; the po'boy was $18 but worth every cent. You could feed 3 people with that monster of a sandwich. If you're in the neighborhood| take the time to stop in. You won't find too many places like this anymore.
1,3,Just finished breakfast here. There are 4 customers here and our food took over 30 minutes to arrive. My order was wrong| they put the wrong veggies in my omelette. Hash browns are dry| generally uninspired breakfast. Save your money and eat at home.
1,0,The food was ok| way overpriced but that I can deal with however the service is terrible. We went here as a group to celebrate my sons 16th birthday on a Wednesday night| first they lost our cake that we had delivered and then once found it was served frozen| secondly they forgot one of our party guests order completely and brought it out finally at almost the same time as the brought the cake. It took two hours by the time we had finished our meal as the service was so slow. I would not return.
1,3,Definitely did not live up to the hype. The service is slow and waiters are very unattentive.------The sea bass had good flavor but watch out for the bones. I probably picked out 10-15 bones while eating... Made the meal less enjoyable as I had to diligently make sure I wasn't about to swallow a bone. The crab cake appetizer had a lot of crab in it but lacked flavor. ------My favorite item was probably the yogurt. Very creamy and fresh... Probably the best yogurt I've ever had.
1,3,Their burgers are ok. they kind of taste like a homemade burger (which is awesome) however| the prices are outlandish. They don't have combos so you have to buy everything "A la carte". Basically| if you want a burger| fries and a drink it will cost you around $15 which I find is pretty expensive. I've gone to mom & pop burger places that have had better quality and prices. The portions are pretty big but too much for the average person to eat in one sitting. The cheese tastes processed and a little bit like plastic. lastly| the wait times are a little long. Every time I've gone in there I've waited at LEAST 14 minutes for my food. I wouldn't recommend if you are looking for something very quick during your 30 minute lunch break.
1,3,This place was crap!! The service was horrible and it wasn't packed that night. Got there at 10pm party of 6. We waited 10 minutes for our waiter. Our waiter could barely speak English|  he was nice thou. It's not his fault the management doesn't know how to train the staff. I order the sesame chicken and it was spicy. We sent it back. The sweet and sour chicken was barely chewable sent that back. Asked for the manager. My host told her how we waited 10 minutes. She snapped back with a reply "actually only 5 minutes".  What kind of manager says that shit. A very crappy manager. Can't charge the amount you do for the food and then give bad hospitality. Never going back!
1,0,I gave it two just because the lunch specials are at very good price. But the service here is terrible. The food takes forever and sometimes it's sitting in the bar for a long time before a waitress takes it. ---Every time takes half hour more than any other restaurant and it's extremely difficult to ask something especial or different. There is often confusion and mistakes with the tab| and usually someone at the table gets the food after everyone else is done.---The food itself its not that great but not terrible especially for that price.---If you have a lot of time and patience and want to save money to eat sushi| this might work for you.
1,0,Restaurant is small cozy. Although we had two hours waiting period at the restaurant it was worth waiting. Food just tastes good brings memory back from India. Loved their cheese butter masala and paneer tikka masala. And service was friendly.
1,0,Where do i start ? Prepackaged pancakes or frozen french toast triangles.maybe its best to start at the mug of mud... I mean coffee. After dropping 40$ for my wife and i we were very disappointed and shocked at how subpar this breakfast buffet was. food quality is what i'd imagine prison food tastes like. The 2 stars are for the delicious orange juice(after the waiter finally brought it to us) along with the delicious bacon. I highly recommend any fastfood joint over this place. Im not sure how lunch or dinner is but luckily wont have to find out.
1,0,Great place to catch an NBA game. Exactly what my group and I ended up doing on a Sunday night. Lots of tv`s and totally worth it. The food is meh alright| nothing special. Our nacho`s took forever to arrive at our table...well over an hour. Then our main meal was nothing special (burgers and salad). ------I would rate this place more for the atmosphere. Great for watching a game with a group of people.
1,0,Had Roy's trio! So delish! THe only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because they took forever to take your drinks and food order.  However| the staff was very friendly.
3,0,After reading great reviews from the Charleston location| and a sushi spot opening close to me| I was looking forward to checking out the new spot.---I made reservations for four on Wednesday night at 6:15| after hearing they have 1/2 price sushi rolls from 5:00-7:00.---We arrived at 6:15 and were seated immediately| and noticed the place was not as crowded as I expected being its first week. Needless to say| I love the atmosphere| great decor| bar and a small sushi bar in the back corner.---We decided to start with the Dim Sum Platter| a mix of Shrimp Shumai and Pork Dumplings| served with ponzu sauce and sweet chili sauce. Both dumplings were good.---We ordered a variety| six| of the specially rolls. All were good| but what I recall from most of them is rice. The two that stood out were the Tuna Roll and Kiwi..yes| Kiwi. I was a little hesitant at first but it was great. The least impressive was the potato roll| one of their most famous. It honestly tasted like McDonalds Hashbrowns| never again.---I was also disappointed that they ran out of soft shell crab| by 6:30| so one of the rolls we wanted we could not try.---Prices are high and the drink menu is limited for wines and quite pricey. Not sure I would rush back| but did enjoy the atmosphere and may stop by for a drink or 1/2 price roll again.
3,0,I went to this restaurant with friends and loved it! The decor is classy and pretty| and service was great. Best of all| however| was the food! Yummy wonton soup| pot stickers| and sweet and sour chicken. The menu is huge so you can always find something new and delicious!
3,0,I dont know how someone can write an entirely positive review and still give only a 3 stars. This place is amazeballs. The specials are cheaper than the elgin mills location that is closer to me. The cornmeal on the pizza bottom is soooooo guuuuuuuud. Wings are just delish| they toss it in sauce after theyre ready. The bacon honey mustard sauce is *high pitched voice* to diiiiieeee for. They are smaller wings but meat is always juicy and skin is flavourful. Marinara sauce is $1 and is a GENEROUS portion. Wait time is less than pizza pizza too. No seating| take out only.
3,0,Popped in for some pub grub before going to the pictures. Staff were very friendly| food was good didn't wait long for our meal| good choice on menu.Few changes on menu from our last visit.Will defo be back.
3,1,Currently this is my favorite place to order take out from.  The quality and freshness is better than any sushi restaurant I ever went to Scarborough and Markham.  One thing I really like is they have some premade orders you can buy right away without having to wait for them to make| plus I rate this place 5 stars is mainly b/c their premade sushi are still fresher than any custom order/instant made ones from other Japanese restaurants around my area.
3,0,Hot and fresh| they never seem to get my order wrong.  This is the only taco bell I trust to make my chili cheese burritos| as well as some of my special orders.------The drive thru staff are always friendly and efficient - last time| they complimented my (blue) hair| which always makes my day.------Comparing to other Taco Bells| it deserves five stars.
3,0,In town for work and was craving steak and eggs..Very friendly staff| clean &  prepared quickly. Both steak and eggs cooked just how I asked.. Exact what anyone needs first thing in the morning. Will definitely return.
3,0,Clean| quirky hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant.  Definitely authentic (they serve Menudo on weekends).  Reminds me of those great little Burrito places where you can get a bite to eat at 3am after drinking. ------Oh wait| you can do that here too!  Whoohoo! =)------Carne Asada tacos + rice + refried beans = great alternative to drive-thru after partying all night.  Everything is made to order.  They boast having the bigges burrito in Las Vegas.  The pictures look convincing.
3,1,This is a restaurant where it's all about the food. The menu may have a few spelling mistakes| some of the food isn't what you'd find on other restaurants menus and that's its appeal. They still do mainstream food but hey why not try something different?------The staff are very welcoming| food to table time is about 15 mins and service is good. The decor isn't amazing but as I say this restaurant is all about the food. Go now| you won't regret it!
3,0,When looking for quick HK style meals| there's always a Kenny's.------Kenny's Noodle| Kenny's Place| Kenny's Delight| ...---One of my favorite Kenny's is located a bit more north... Kenny's Gourmet.------This food here is cheap and tasty.---They have lunch specials| the menu is big| and the portions are filling.---The restaurant is clean| bright| and I rarely have to wait for a table.------Decent HK style tea is always a bonus. ---I tend to order typical baked rice dishes - black pepper chicken is good here.---As for fried rices| the soft shell crab fried rice has tasty bits of crab.---A small selection of Chinese desserts is available too.------If you want a casual lunch or dinner this is a great spot.---Cheap| large portions| tasty| and consistent.
3,0,Well finally a place that reminds me of my country!!! Street TACOS!!!! Had a family member that lives around the corner from the place that told me and the wifey about it. ---Great place to go eat late at night| made fresh to order right in front of your FACE! We ordered a Carne asada burrito| AWESOME!! Asada Quesadilla HUGE and yummy!! And a couple of Asada and chicken tacos| great taste. ---Only thing is that i wish they had more of a meat variety. But all in all this place ROCKS!!!! ---Going there tonight again with the Wifey for some good ASS tacos!!!!------If you love Authentic Street tacos this place is for you| Go ahead and give it a try!!!---$1 tacos| cant beat that!!------By the way bring cash| dont think they have a credit card machine!| LOL
3,0,Great little spot for a fast weekend breakfast or workday lunch. Very friendly| accommodating and eager to please. And the place is spotless.------The menu situation can be confusing. They seem to have more dishes on offer that you would think -- be sure to ask about specials. I'd recommend a specials board that they can change daily in addition to the chalkboard menu behind the counter. ------One little ambience minus: Radio tuned to a Top-40 station is a little intrusive especially when there are commercials. Proprietors should consider hooking up an iPod instead and lowering the volume a little.
3,1,A while ago I was in for a lunch salad and I remember that it wasn't very...well| memorable. I drive by this place every day and I've never been enticed to come back and try their breakfast. ------Until recently| that is...------Wonderfully hot| healthy and very tasty|--not to mention reasonably priced--breakfast wrap (happily made with my requested egg whites)!------Owing to the fact that I was "in and out" in about 8 minutes| AZ Bread Co. is now on my list of places to stop once a week for my "breakfast out" treat. ------I also appreciated the friendly smiles from all employees!
3,0,I read the reviews and tips before going and they are spot on get the pork fundido. It is great. I called my order in and picked it up through the drive tru in no time. The only problem is the fundido got a little soggy| but still delicious. ------The churro is equally as delicious.
3,0,This place is so cute! I came here after walking by it several times. It is the perfect lunch spot - quick| delicious| and cheap! The turkey with bacon on the ciabatta was excellent! And the Sante Fe wrap is also great! It came with a side of soup (I got the chili and it hit the spot) and a drink for $9! I'll definitely be back!
3,0,Decided to come hear today| with my family| right after visiting the desert botanical garden. Arrived around late afternoon. Got seated right away. Our server Torrence immediately brought us water. He gave us a good amount of time before asking us for what we wanted to eat. Recommended traditional wings and bbq items which turned out great. Mac and cheese was also amazing. Overall experience was great very happy with the food and service.
3,1,This place was excellent! It was very| very busy| but they got us to a table quickly. Our waiter (despite the noise and crowd| there were a lot of people there) was incredible. So attentive and accommodating. Warm and relaxed ambience. Beautifully decorated. It's not cheap but it is reasonable and it's well worth the quality of food and service you receive. Love this place
3,1,Almost two years since my last review| but not much has changed at all. The crowds are still here| but we only had a five minute wait at 9:30 AM. My $9 meal was top notch and included two buttermilk pancakes| crispy bacon and two eggs scrambled and fruit. Everything was spot on perfect and the coffee got refilled promptly and waitress was excellent as well. Always a solid choice at breakfast.
3,0,Went into Paramount because it was late and we were looking for something quick to eat.  Had no prior knowledge of what Paramount is like| it was chaotic at first| but there was order to the chaos!  Remember your table number if you were going to order and stay to eat.  The line-up was the longest wait I had.  Despite the crazy amount of people dining| our food was served at an exceptional speed!  The hummus was fresh and light and the falafels were fantastic!  Will probably return in the future!
3,0,We go here almost every weekend. They have such a great selection of breakfast items and our food gets to our table in the blink of an eye! Their waffles are most definitely my favorite!
3,0,This place was great! Colin| Larry and Christina were so helpful| attentive| sweet and gave the best recommendations on what to Order For us first timers. They delivered our sandwiches to our table right away and cleaned up as soon as they saw we were finished. Thank you for the great service! Will come back when back working in vegas! :)
3,1,Wait time is about 15 minutes for a full pizza so you can preorder online or by phoning ahead. They have pick up specials too!------There are a few stools where can eat and a couple of small tables inside.------When the weather is warmer| they'll have about 3 tables and 12 chairs for outdoor eating although you are beside Yonge Street so hopefully that just becomes white noise for you.------One thing I like about Pizza Nova is the bacon topping looks like cut bacon strips and not like it was a bacon sausage removed from the casing.------A popular place for quick meals south of Sheppard and on the eastside of Yonge.
3,0,Love this place! Small portions so you can try more things and budget friendly! The food is good too and if you dont like whats on the revolving belt then you can order off of the menu! Will definitely be back!
3,0,Come in on a busy Saturday night. Only one bartender | Kimmy| was working. Even though she was spread thin| she gave amazing service. Never let our beers go empty and food was delivered hot. She had a great personality! Everything we ordered was delicious! The beer selection was great and it was fun to try something different! I defiantly recommend this place for somewhere casual but a step up from your usual neighborhood bar.
3,1,The pizza is amazing! We usually get the white pizza with chicken and artichokes| try it.  I also recommended getting a dessert| try the Tiramisu or the cheese cake. The prices are also phenomenal for the quality of pizza. If there was any downside to this amazing restaurant it is that the wings are just your basic wings| not bad| but now WOW like the pizza is. The people who work there are nice and friendly and the service is quick.
3,0,Went in after a Panthers game. Aka after work. Loved the menu. I could have picked any one of 10 things| especially on the specials menu. The special burger looked amazing. Love the Asian BBQ fusion. Service was quick and attentive. I went with the BBQ chicken| sweet potato hash and the Brussels. Really like the Brussels. The sweet potato hash was tasty but more like a mash. The chicken was tender. The sauce gave it flavor. Wife had the Asian salad and we both loved that. I would go back to try the special burger or sandwich and maybe go more on the Asian side.
