0,3,It reminds me of Panera Bread.---Most of the store open 24 hours & they're everywhere in every corner.---It has variety of breads| donuts| soups & sandwiches.---I personally like the coffee more than Starbucks.---The coffee has this robust & flavorful taste and aroma.---The only they can do better is to have the self-serve station available.
0,3,As with so much of the food offerings from this area| what I encountered here today is a great concept| poorly executed. I like the market/restaurant/cafe combo| and was excited about visiting here| as it's quite close to home for me. And| while I enjoyed the market and the cafe| the restaurant fell short. It's a lovely enough space| with farm house style tables for communal dining and a wood fired oven. The menu is concise and easy to understand: pizza| sandwiches| salad and wood fired wings. I tried a salad with their house dressing and wood fired chicken| and a cup of their house soup| which is creamy tomato and roasted red pepper. I enjoyed the soup| but the salad was a disappointing mess. Their house dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette| which was not great tasting and had enough dried herbs in it that they resembled lawn cuttings. The roasted veggies were fine| but the chicken breast was so dry...well| the Sahara is a dewy oasis in comparison to this chicken breast. For the exective chef| if you're reading this...I would rather wait and have you fire up a fresh chicken breast than eat the one your staff cooked off this morning and then rewarmed in the oven. Chicken cooked this way will never| ever be moist and tasty. I know it saves you time and makes things move along more smoothly to do as much prep ahead of time as possible| but this is one area where you might want to not cut corners. I ended up sending my salad back and getting another that was equally dry. That was their opportunity to do it right| so they failed twice. I like the market and the cafe| but will be skipping lunch at this place in the future.
0,3,After reading great reviews from the Charleston location| and a sushi spot opening close to me| I was looking forward to checking out the new spot.---I made reservations for four on Wednesday night at 6:15| after hearing they have 1/2 price sushi rolls from 5:00-7:00.---We arrived at 6:15 and were seated immediately| and noticed the place was not as crowded as I expected being its first week. Needless to say| I love the atmosphere| great decor| bar and a small sushi bar in the back corner.---We decided to start with the Dim Sum Platter| a mix of Shrimp Shumai and Pork Dumplings| served with ponzu sauce and sweet chili sauce. Both dumplings were good.---We ordered a variety| six| of the specially rolls. All were good| but what I recall from most of them is rice. The two that stood out were the Tuna Roll and Kiwi..yes| Kiwi. I was a little hesitant at first but it was great. The least impressive was the potato roll| one of their most famous. It honestly tasted like McDonalds Hashbrowns| never again.---I was also disappointed that they ran out of soft shell crab| by 6:30| so one of the rolls we wanted we could not try.---Prices are high and the drink menu is limited for wines and quite pricey. Not sure I would rush back| but did enjoy the atmosphere and may stop by for a drink or 1/2 price roll again.
0,1,Five stars all around| if u could give more I certainly would. ---First| the Valet guy was extremely nice and not only did he move cars but he held doors open and was funny and polite. ---Second| The ambiance is so nice| loud| and dark| it makes it comfy and a cute place for a date. I would just say| not a recommended child friendly restaurant; just because the place is tight and too loud and fast.---Third| the host was nice and pointed us to the bar right away because the house was full| but the bar did not disappoint. ---Fourth| menu is large and safe to say the mermaid roll was delicious| the seaweed salad was nice sized and yummy and the spicy edamame was addicting| the bar tender also hooked us up with some nice sushi| unfortunately I forgot what it was called.---Last but not least| the service was great| my drink remained full and my seaweed salad took a while to come out and they paid for it while also giving us some great sushi to try. Mark the bartender was extremely helpful| sweet and I would come back just for him! 10/10!! So happy it's in the neighborhood.
0,3,Wow what a pleasant surprise. Just moved to Charlotte this afternoon and decided to walk outside and grab a quick dinner when we stumbled into the soft opening of O-Ku. The wine pairing was great and slightly unusual in that we had South African and Oregon wines that were crisp| different (from the usual standards)| and delicious. We split Spicy Edamame (yummy but not markedly unusual)| Ceviche Tacos ( nice presentation and very flavorful)| and Miso soup. For the main course we had the Mermaid Roll (fresh with a new twist)| Potato Roll (the winner of the evening!!)| and Curry Duck (large portion cooked perfectly with unusual type of eggplant). The service was excellent from the hostess| server Megan| and manager Justin. The ambiance was very nice in such an old eclectic building and the indirect lighting and lighting fixtures really set the tone for a cozy evening. They plan on having half price sushi happy hours Monday and Wednesday and we definitely plan on returning.  What a great evening. So happy to know that we can walk outside Ashton South End and enjoy such a nice (and healthy) evening. Thank you O-Ku!
1,3,It was pretty much what I expected - high end ambiance to justify outrageous prices.  I knew this ahead of time so I waited until I had an opportunity to host a work dinner.  So this week I had a customer come to town and took him and my partner.  We went early (~5:30) because we were going to a hornets game afterwards.  I assumed I wouldn't need a reservation at that early hour but when we arrived the hostess said she could only seat us at the sushi bar.  I called her bluff and said we'd go somewhere else and the manager who happened to be standing next to her seated us at a table.  We ordered a some apps| which were good but teeny tiny| and the sushi was fine but I don't think I could take a pepsi challenge against any other sushi place in town if you took off the fancy presentation.  As expected with cocktails| sake| wine| and 3 hungry diners the bill was astronomical (and the rolls were half off!).  If you're looking to keep costs down stay away from the nigiri.  I'm not a sucker for high end experience and prefer a more casual environment.  Ru-san's is my favorite in Charlotte and I'd go there over this place any time.
1,0,Such a cool atmosphere!  The food tasted good and was of good quality but the portions on the sushi / sashimi combo were stingy. Our waiter also never explained what was in the combo| even when I asked ("chef's choice") or when it was served. The service was also very slow| especially as we had a 9pm reservation; not prime time. I'd go back with the hopes that the service improves and I'd definitely order something else but I wouldn't be the one leading the charge.
1,3,American Chinese food. The schezuan style is not authentic here just as a heads up.  It's cooked in a tangy Americanized type suace instead of hot oil and red peppers. I've never had a curry taste so sticky/syrupy even with a coconut milk base. $16 for two small soft shell crab was kind of pricey in my opinion.------My waiter was clueless...wasn't very helpful or attentive. I was served a sushi roll of white tuna when I had asked for a sashimi dish as an appetizer.   He took it back| but I ended up waiting until after our dinner was done (30 minutes later) for me to tell him to cancel it altogether. Really disappointing.
1,0,Review for sushi only.------Apparently| Pearl of the Orient has been serving sushi for several years. I don't eat much Chinese food (none| really) so I had no knowledge of this until my hair stylist mentioned it one day.------I went in on a Friday evening at 6pm-ish and sat at the bar. I ordered 2 sushi rolls (rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll) and they were prepared and in front of me immediately as the sushi chef wasn't busy. I devoured it like it was my last meal. I ordered a third roll (a Philly roll| I think) and it was in front of me in less than 2 minutes. The bartender| who was very attentive| suggested that it's hit or miss as to whether the sushi chef is really busy or not and whether you get your sushi quickly. ------I had zero complaints about the sushi. It wasn't gigantic| which is neither here nor there for me. I don't think giant pieces of sushi equals quality or deliciousness. My only comment was that the sushi seemed kind of warm and soft and fell apart somewhat easily (as opposed to cool and tightly packed| I guess). ------Now that I'm writing about sushi| I want it| so I'm sure I'll be returning soon. There aren't many (any?) options for sushi in Lakewood/Rocky River so I'll certainly check it out again soon.
1,0,I was missing "Brazilian sushi" and Temaki for a while when I found out about this place. I ordered it by delivery and it came in less then thirty minutes. I ordered Maguro Tataki| Salmon Temaki and a Shrimp Temaki. They're really tasty like the ones I've eaten in Brazil! ---I just don't give five star because of the price| it was quite expensive and it wasn't so much food. If they had an All You Can Eat for a good price I would go there every time I could.
1,3,I was one of the party of 11 that went with another reviewer. I agree whole heartedly with the experience related by him. Rude waiter (clinton as noted in other reviews) SLOW service. I think they had 2 guys getting meat at a time. 5-10 minutes between skewers of which they would give a slice in the same amount as a slice of ham from a package for sandwiches in a grocery store. A slice from that package. Seriously| we got some alligator (after requesting it) and the size was like popcorn chicken from KFC| and I got 2 pieces.  For a 400+ plus bill| this was a very bad experience. ------Only thing good that night was the garlic beef and the bar (yesterdays| next door| not related to this place)  that saved the night for our group.
1,0,Went here for sushi| we ordered the volcano dip as an appetizer. It was ok served with wafer crackers| as for the sushi we got the spicy tuna| Philly roll and the tempura shrimp. Both tuna and philly lacked flavor the tempura had a good flavor but overall the pieces were little and needless to say we had to make a mcdonalds stop on the way home. Good sushi just not enough for the price and flavor!
1,0,Pretty good pho| excellent service. Very clean quiet place with friendly people. The P2 meatballs were tough and stringy| and there wasn't a lot of meat. The vegetable/herb plate was kind of lean too| but they brought more when I asked. The combo appetizer plate was delicious. Overall this is a solid choice for pho in the west valley.
1,3,I've been here 3 times now and each time I leave feeling dissatisfied. The chicken portions are small.  The sides are decent| like the fries. Their sides are nothing to write home about. They make a good sangria. The chicken I always get tends to be on the drier side.  Their sauces are what stands out at this place.  Other than that I'd rather cook my own chicken than pay the price at Nandos. I hope my friends don't drag me here again haha.
3,0,Irie food Joint is a mix of traditional Jamaican Cuisine| with a twist of new world Queen St West flavor. ---The atmosphere is not typical of a Jamaican Pattie restaurant| there is comfortable seating| a garage door that opens up freely to the street| and soft grooves that keep the atmosphere relaxing.---The food is amazing| the staple roti's are available for dine in or take out| or try expanding your palette with some firecracker shrimp as an appetizer! There is one thing that is very reminiscent of the Jamaicans...SPICE! Be prepared to gulp down some milk when experiencing some of the hottest flavors in town.---Fair prices| and space to enjoy a small gathering or group make this restaurant a great choice for any dining experience.
3,1,Always good food served by wonderful staff and Chris the manager. ------New specials everyday. Prices are great and portion sizes are usually big. ------Awesome place to get a bite before heading out of the Atlantic terminal.
3,0,My boyfriend and I went last night for dinner and this time we brought a friend! The service from the minute you walk in the door to the minute you get sat was exceptional! The atmosphere was great and everyone was so welcoming! We got sat right away and our waiter came rather quickly with our drinks. We tried the southend shrimp| salmon tartar| and the yellowtail carpaccio for appetizers. Let me tell you they were delicious!! The shrimp was my favorite. If you love spicy that is the way to go!! For entrees we got the uni pasta| chicken teriyaki and the mermaid roll! We were stuffed. Not only were they delicious but they were very satisfying. The manager came to our table and introduced himself. He gave us the appetizers on the HOUSE. It was unreal. They really do take good care of their customers. We loved it and will definitely come back but with a larger crowd for sure!
3,1,I just go here for the confident girls that were fake tans| big boobs and little shorts really really well. Its a chill joint. very noisy food is big and fattening beer is ice cold. if you want fun and easy go here. its a chill bar but the crowd here is business men on lunch and tourists so people are cleaned up a bit. not a roll out of bed joint------I always get great service| they care about your driving ability after a few dirty blonde's (house beer) ------First impression is great everyone must go at least one and attended on at least one major holiday!
3,0,First of all! $1 Oysters? ---Amazing food quality and overall ambience| the servers were not pushy| extremely attentive| and always showed up at the right moments------We ordered a dozen oysters| the pulpo appetizer| chicken pot pie| and bread pudding to share between two people and could barely stand up by the end of the meal. It was a perfect mixture of gourmet and comfort food and we thought the prices were decent. Personally| would recommand the pulpo and the oysters (they are from PEI)------Will definitely return next time to try the burgers and the braised ribs (as suggested by our waitress)
3,0,We took the 55 bus to Schwartz's. Upon arriving we had no idea how Schwartz's ordering worked so we waited in line. After 15 minutes in line we realized that if you are taking sandwiches to go that you don't have to wait in the line outside. Just walk in and place your order. Soooo| after waiting for 15 minutes we figured we would wait for a table. ------While waiting for the table we smelled a terrible sewage/garbage smell coming from a alley area directly connected to Schwartz. This totally ruined our appetites but we still waited. After 25 minutes our party of 4 was seated. We ordered the 1lb smoked meat platter for about 15 bucks. It comes with meat and bread. ------The smoked meat has a good flavor to it. It is spiced differently than Katz Deli and I really don't believe you can compare the two. Schwartz smoked meat is different from pastrami. I will say that when I visit Montreal again I will probably skip Schwartz if there is a line.  It is good but not worth a 25 minute wait and I could find comparable or better meats here in NYC.
3,0,I skipped the line and just got a 1/4 pound of meat and a small side of coleslaw at the deli counter. I would have had a sandwich| but the day was early and I wanted to save room for other spots on my list. Also| it's a bit hard to go to a Schwartz's when you are traveling with a vegetarian friend. Meat was delicious and just the right amount of fat. Seriously falls apart| which is slightly comical when you're siting on a bench trying fork some into your mouth| horrifying your non-meat eating friend with your carnivours ways. Coleslaw was great| nice and crisp which cut through the fat taste in my mouth.
3,1,I think if you're to go to any restaurant in Montreal to get a taste of the city you need to go to Schwartz's. I remember coming here a while back during the day time and having a fantasticly huge smoked meat sandwich. Thankfully| one of the best things about Schwartz's is that you can get yourself one of these bad boys at pretty much any time of day. So when I needed my midnight snack I knew I had to come here. ------Ok first of all I don't even like smoked meat. Except here| of course. Anywhere else I can't do it. So I ordered 2 medium smoked meat sandwiches| 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 half sours. Sadly they were out of half sours so I ordered a regular pickle.Despite there being a line (even at 12AM)| the service was polite and efficient. Just a reminder| these guys are cash only| but theres an ATM in the back. For the 4 sandwiches+pickle it came to $36| pricey I guess| but totally worth it. I realized I forgot my cherry coke on the way out which was plain silly.------The meat was a bit dry. It wasn't moist and delicious like the first time I had it| perhaps because it was at night? Perhaps there was more fat on it the first time? Either way| it was still so huge it was nearly impossible to eat| and the amazing spices were all there so it still tasted great.  The pickle was also great| if you haven't had a pickle that isn't from a jar you bought at the grocery store| you need to. I don't know why they're so much better but they are. The turkey was also exceptionally good| but it was a cold cut| still it was seasoned wonderfully and also nearly impossible to eat like the smoked meat one. Also they threw in a few extra pickles for me! Yay-------1 point for the meat being dry. I'm sure it was an isolated incident ! :) Can't wait to be back.
3,1,So my Asian-persuasion boyfriend and I are on a quest to find decent Chinese food on the West side. I dragged him away from his favorite| Hunan of Solon| this summer because I just couldn't stand living on the East side anymore! So now that I am the Wicked Witch of the West (pun intended) I vowed to find him a place that would do his beloved Mongolian Beef dish justice. Up until this week I was failing miserably. Then one night on the way home from work I suggested we stop at the Pearl of the Orient. I hadn't been there in ages| but I remember my parents always saying good things about the food there. The restaurant is very small| I would guess no more than 15 tables in the joint| but decorated nicely. We were there late on a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty| but I'm not sure I would risk going on a weekend night and having to wait a while for a table to open up. We started off with an order of the braised potstickers and soup. The potstickers themselves were good| but the sauce served with them was very tart and vinegary. I thought it was a little overwhelming and didn't compliment the dish very well. The wonton soup was just OK. Not the best I have ever had and it was only luke warm when served to me. I was a little nervous going into the main course. I was so sure that the Mongolian Beef would once again not meet the expectations of the BF. It was served and he noticed the bean sprouts and carrots right away. "Not traditional"| he said and I just rolled my eyes and groaned. Here we go again. He took a bite| chewed thoughtfully and said "but still the best I've had on the West side". WOO HOO!!!! +1 for me!!!! I ordered the Honey Walnut Chicken and was happy with the large pieces of quality chicken breast| however the sauce was a little too thick and sweet for my liking. But I didn't care because I think we found our new West side "regular" Chinese joint! ------A few things to mention: ----On Monday nights they have a special of buy one chicken dish| get one for $1. What a steal! ----They offer you the choice of white or brown rice - nice to have options ----The soy sauce they serve is not your normal Kikomans. It has a thicker consistency and is WAY stronger. Seriously people| a drop of this stuff goes a long way.
3,0,We have come in to Pearl of the Orient multiple times. The reason I give it three stars is because it is always a bit different because of who ever is cooking in the back. Some of the cooks are better then the others. ------The food is delicious| the sushi is great (takes a little long to make so be ready to wait) and the main dishes are large enough to share. ------The service is very nice and everyone is helpful explaining things on the menu. It is a quitter atmosphere and I rarely see the bar completely filled but if you want some good Chinese| then this is definitely better then any takeout you have had.
3,1,We've been coming to The Pearl for more than a quarter century| so I figured it's time to post a review.------This is a favorite of our family. Food is always very good| portions are more than fair| and service is always friendly. Their pot stickers are the best we've had anywhere. Sushi is good too| but can be a bit slow to get to the table.------The owner is a great man who always visits tables to check on his customers.
3,0,We enjoyed a sold dinner here this week. Tried some sushi and a chicken dinner. Enjoyed wonton soup and split a non- noteworthy egg roll. ---Spicy tuna roll was delicious- lots of tuna and not overly mixed with spicy mayo or over-rocked. Will definitely go back for it since there is NO sushi in this area unless you count Heinens!!! ---The eel and cucumber was also delish. My hubs loves eel and he totally enjoyed this one. ---We split the bourbon chicken- it was nice but not really something notable. ---Overall I think this is a solid spot for sushi and I would give it another spin for sure. Service was great and the place was pretty busy on a weeknight. ---I also took into account the fact that they do specials! Love that and makes it a nice option for a weeknight dinner.
3,1,I will definitely be going back here! I love the fusion menu and the decor is kitschy but cute. Their noodle dishes are huge but their salads are the perfect size and not overwhelmed with random toppings.
3,0,Clean| quirky hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant.  Definitely authentic (they serve Menudo on weekends).  Reminds me of those great little Burrito places where you can get a bite to eat at 3am after drinking. ------Oh wait| you can do that here too!  Whoohoo! =)------Carne Asada tacos + rice + refried beans = great alternative to drive-thru after partying all night.  Everything is made to order.  They boast having the bigges burrito in Las Vegas.  The pictures look convincing.
3,0,Stopped in for lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised.---I split the steamed dumplings with a friend - tasty| but nothing made them especially stand out. The complimentary salad with ginger dressing and an eggroll was a nice touch and my Udon Noodle dish was delicious. For $8.50| I had a filling lunch| and enough left over to take home for dinner. I will definitely go again.
3,0,It's been a while since I have been satisfied with food| service and ambience all in the same place. But this place has nailed it! Even with the new opening they were still quick and friendly.  And the food....??large portions and meat so tender it falls off the bone. The donuts at the end are a perfect touch. Good job!! We will definitely be back and recommending to family and friends!!
