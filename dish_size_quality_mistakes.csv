0,1,Dashed in here to buy some soup for my very sore throat.  Decided upon the new spicy Thai chicken.  They now sell large as well.  As I am waking out the bottom falls out of the bag and the soup bun and utensils fall all over the floor.  No one working notices and so I pick up everything and put the soup and bag on the counter to show the staff that the bag broke.   I told them what happened and the staff member told me that she just washed the floor so the soup would be okay.  I told her no I want a fresh one.  While she is getting me a new order I explained to her that the bottom of the bag was wet which is why it broke.  As she hands me my new order the new bag bottom is wet as well.  I grabbed it from the bottom and told her that the bag was wet again and she should warn people.  She told me a few times.... It's just water.   She didn't or refused to understand that she kept making the bottom of the bags wet.  When I got home with my soup the butter was melted.
0,3,Very good sandwiches; I have tried the turkey on pretzel bread and the roast beef on cibatta.  Good location; easy to get to off of Park  Ave.  There is a free parking deck out back and metered parking on South Blvd.  Outdoor seating is in the shade and the place was very clean and friendly.  Free WiFi is always a plus. Only 4 stars because it is a little pricey; sandwiches are between $7 & $8 and come with either a drink OR chips (other sides available); so expect to pay $10.  Right now there are specials here on Yelp and also at Restaurant.com.  If I could have given 4 1/2 I would have. I would like to try breakfast but they don't open till 8am and i'm already at work.  Not many people in there when I went and I would like to see the place take off because I really liked it; the sandwiches are that good.
0,3,It's an Arby's like any other Arby's...    staff's always been friendly and food's always been a good value.       The facility seems clean;  even if the interior's a bit dated - I don't go to a quick serve restaurant to be wowed by the ambiance.  ------I'm giving them 4 stars because as Arby's go;  they're fine.
0,3,Food is always good and Mark; the general manager; and his crew are always attentive and courteous. They always have creative lunch specials and yummy homemade desserts too.
0,3,Food is alright but the worst part about this place is their meal hours. They are conveniently located in Atlantic Aviation (the General Aviation FBO) so patrons of the FBO just may be most of their business? Very often we (flight crews) leave there in the morning and want to take a sandwich with us for lunch. BUT; they won't sell you a sandwich before lunch.   It's not that they can't; they won't. Patrons are told "I can make it; but I'll get in trouble". The manager needs to wake up and realize who their customers are.
0,3,Slowest.......McDonald's........ever.  Do not; I repeat; DO NOT come here if you think you're going to just waltz through here on your way to work.  You'll be better off stopping at the farm to pick up your ham; eggs; and cheese to make your own McMuffin.  This is newly remodeled with two drive-thru lanes; which is hilarious considering they were ten times faster when they had just one.  I have been here on about four separate occasions that I can remember; three being drive-thru; and I have (not exaggerating in the least) waited 10-15 minutes every single time.  Of these four times not once did I go during a peak busy hour and sometimes I was the only one in line.  Not sure what they're doing in there but it definitely isn't fast...
0,3,As with so much of the food offerings from this area; what I encountered here today is a great concept; poorly executed. I like the market/restaurant/cafe combo; and was excited about visiting here; as it's quite close to home for me. And; while I enjoyed the market and the cafe; the restaurant fell short. It's a lovely enough space; with farm house style tables for communal dining and a wood fired oven. The menu is concise and easy to understand: pizza; sandwiches; salad and wood fired wings. I tried a salad with their house dressing and wood fired chicken; and a cup of their house soup; which is creamy tomato and roasted red pepper. I enjoyed the soup; but the salad was a disappointing mess. Their house dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette; which was not great tasting and had enough dried herbs in it that they resembled lawn cuttings. The roasted veggies were fine; but the chicken breast was so dry...well; the Sahara is a dewy oasis in comparison to this chicken breast. For the exective chef; if you're reading this...I would rather wait and have you fire up a fresh chicken breast than eat the one your staff cooked off this morning and then rewarmed in the oven. Chicken cooked this way will never; ever be moist and tasty. I know it saves you time and makes things move along more smoothly to do as much prep ahead of time as possible; but this is one area where you might want to not cut corners. I ended up sending my salad back and getting another that was equally dry. That was their opportunity to do it right; so they failed twice. I like the market and the cafe; but will be skipping lunch at this place in the future.
0,3,The market-restaurant-cafe combo is very nice. My wife makes the Italian seven-fishes dinner for Christmas eve and the anchovies we got from the market were the best. I've had the sandwiches a few times and they are very good. The hot peppers are nice if you like a good kick in the taste buds. The only drawback is the limited menu.
0,3,I was so excited to try the latest local restaurant.  I really need a go to place for lunch in a pinch and just have nothing to eat in the McMurray area at all.  I loved the concept.  The market; cafe and coffee shops all in a row.  It's really beautiful; I love the menu and the place was packed.  I was ready.  ------I ordered the 3 brothers sandwich.  Veggies in foccacia with a side salad basically.   They have pasta; pizzas; soups and salads as well as sandwiches baked in a brick oven.  The pizzas looked good but I wasn't really in the mood.  Besides; each one that came out got a ridiculous looking handful of parm or something to finish and made me cringe a little.  I would have to try one to see what they're all about.  ------My sandwich was a little salty.  The foccacia wasn't great and I really thought that instead of button mushrooms it should have had portabellas.  The side salad looked nice but I absolutely hated the balsamic dressing.  It was awful and they put it on absolutely everything.  I think it was the olive oil they use that I objected to.  It didn't go with the vinegar or something it just was all off somehow and I really didn't like it.  I also thought it wasn't a great value.  You don't get enough food for the money.------I tried my wife's salad with grilled chicken.  The chicken wasn't edible and she had the same dressing.  The Italian baguette they served with it was a little on the stale side and beside that I saw the lady who handled the money dishing them out on plates.  Don't touch the money and then touch my food please.  ------Go check out the nice little market and have a cup of coffee next door.  The market serves cold sandwiches and you probably can't go wrong there.  It's a nice concept.  Maybe they'll pull it together over time.  I am pulling for them.
0,3,Excellent addition to the South End neighborhood. This is a solid place for a dinner date or a cocktail. Very trendy; kind of urban chic atmosphere. The place was packed on Friday night.  ------The wine and food are fairly pricey; but good. Bottles of wine range from $45-$110 per bottle and sushi rolls range from $11-$25. ------I highly recommend the south end shrimp appetizer and the potato sushi roll. Both were fantastic. ------Though pricey; the food; atmosphere; and location are great. I'll be back; especially for half price sushi night on Mondays and Wednesdays.
0,3,If you're wondering why this place is packed on a Saturday night; it's not because the place is trendy; or that the staff is super friendly; or that it just opened. While all of this holds true; it's simply because the food is outstanding. This place is the definition of #WorthTheWait.------And is it really waiting if you're sipping on some drinks? Check in; give the hostess your name; and head over to their convenient bar with a staff that knows how to burn a drink. Relax; enjoy the ambiance; and let your cocktail ease that hangriness out of your system while you wait for your exceptional dinner.------We had the cracked shrimp appetizer which might of been my favorite appetizer I've ever had at an Asian restaurant. I don't even like sashimi but we tried it anyway; and guess what? It was delicious. Top it all of the sushi was prepared fresh and we finished every bite. If you're looking for some great Asian cuisine; look no further; O-Ku is your spot.
0,1,Only rating this based off my experience there last night. Didn't get to try any fooWas wanting to try this after eating at O-Ku in Charleston. The weather was perfect last night; a Wednesday; so a wait anywhere around 7 was expected. I called ahead and asked what the wait would be. The hostess let me know that we would be one of the first to be seated. I asked how many minutes that would take and she said it all depends on when we get there and they will assess. We got there within 10 minutes. The hostess said it was a 20 minute wait. Odd; since on the phone she said we would be one of the first seated. I felt like they baited us into coming in to wait. After over 20 minutes I asked how much longer and she said we'll be seated soon and that parties that came in after us had reservations. 10 minutes later; they seat our party of 3 at the bar. We asked for a table and she said there's a wait for a table and that there's 7 groups ahead of us for a table. Over the phone we were one of the first to be seated and w. We just left and went to Futo Buta instead. Don't appreciate how we were lied to from the get go. We shouldn't have stuck around.
0,1,After reading great reviews from the Charleston location; and a sushi spot opening close to me; I was looking forward to checking out the new spot.---I made reservations for four on Wednesday night at 6:15; after hearing they have 1/2 price sushi rolls from 5:00-7:00.---We arrived at 6:15 and were seated immediately; and noticed the place was not as crowded as I expected being its first week. Needless to say; I love the atmosphere; great decor; bar and a small sushi bar in the back corner.---We decided to start with the Dim Sum Platter; a mix of Shrimp Shumai and Pork Dumplings; served with ponzu sauce and sweet chili sauce. Both dumplings were good.---We ordered a variety; six; of the specially rolls. All were good; but what I recall from most of them is rice. The two that stood out were the Tuna Roll and Kiwi..yes; Kiwi. I was a little hesitant at first but it was great. The least impressive was the potato roll; one of their most famous. It honestly tasted like McDonalds Hashbrowns; never again.---I was also disappointed that they ran out of soft shell crab; by 6:30; so one of the rolls we wanted we could not try.---Prices are high and the drink menu is limited for wines and quite pricey. Not sure I would rush back; but did enjoy the atmosphere and may stop by for a drink or 1/2 price roll again.
0,3,Sweetie and I wanted to try something different for our anniversary and we like sushi; so why not go and see what all the fuss is about?------I made a reservation on OpenTable for a Friday night; 6:30 so I didn't have to wait in the line that was sure to be formed by then and off we go.  I got the obligatory reminder call on Friday afternoon by a pleasant lady which is always a nice touch.------We showed up and they had free valet parking which is a nice touch since nothing is worse than parking your own car and having to find a spot at a hot; new restaurant where everyone else is.  Walked in to a nicely decorated; well thought out space.  So dark I had to use my cell flashlight for the menu.  Nice music playing and servers were plentiful.  We got a nice hightop near the front door which was a nice table to start but as the restaurants filled up the overflow from the bar with people waiting for seats got a bit annoying as I really could care less about the guy this lady picked up on Tinder but was forced to listen to because she stood right near my table.------Our server was nice; attentive and was good at what he did.  I'm not a drinker so I usually order Iced Tea and come to find out they don't have Iced Tea on the menu.  WTF?  This is an outrage; all "sushi places" have Iced Tea.  Besides; this place originated in Charleston SC; the birthplace of Iced Tea and they're in the south for crying out loud.  This must change; now.  Anyway; I sipped on Charlotte's finest tap water instead.  ------Appetizer was the O-Ku Spring Roll which I highly recommend.  Nice selection of fish; some wonton crisps for added crunch and an outstanding sesame sauce for dipping.  Well done!  I grade a sushi place by the innovative specialty rolls and frankly O-Ku needs to beef it up; they only have about dozen on the menu and not too many standouts.  We had a Rainbow; Kiwi Kani; and Mermaid.  The Kiwi Kani fit the bill of innovative; and was delicious; the addition of the fresh kiwi made the roll and it was wonderful.  Dare I say one of the best rolls in the Queen City.  I noticed on the menu that they had fresh wasabi; not the green dyed horseradish that most have.  Come to find out they were out.  Here we go again; no Tea and no fresh wasabi?  Our Server suggested the pickled wasabi instead which was different and I must say; excellent.  Added a different dimension to the meal.  We finished with an almond cake or something and it was a nice cap to the meal.------I liked O-Ku.  They're still new but if you're looking for a new "See and be seen" place this is it.  Nicely done place with good food.
0,3,Five stars all around; if u could give more I certainly would. ---First; the Valet guy was extremely nice and not only did he move cars but he held doors open and was funny and polite. ---Second; The ambiance is so nice; loud; and dark; it makes it comfy and a cute place for a date. I would just say; not a recommended child friendly restaurant; just because the place is tight and too loud and fast.---Third; the host was nice and pointed us to the bar right away because the house was full; but the bar did not disappoint. ---Fourth; menu is large and safe to say the mermaid roll was delicious; the seaweed salad was nice sized and yummy and the spicy edamame was addicting; the bar tender also hooked us up with some nice sushi; unfortunately I forgot what it was called.---Last but not least; the service was great; my drink remained full and my seaweed salad took a while to come out and they paid for it while also giving us some great sushi to try. Mark the bartender was extremely helpful; sweet and I would come back just for him! 10/10!! So happy it's in the neighborhood.
0,3,Great food. Excellent service. Sexy atmosphere. ------We went on a Monday night for a birthday dinner. When we walked in my initial thoughts were; this place is sexy AND it is WAY too loud in here to be half full. ------The hostess repeatedly asked us a ton of questions because she could barely hear us despite the fact that we were standing directly in front of her. They asked a TON of questions before seating us; including our phone number. Not sure why they needed all the info as we didn't have a reservation and didn't need to wait for a table. ------Our server was excellent. Her name is Linda. We found out at the end of the night that she was in training; but she did a great job. ------We had two sushi rolls: the mermaid roll and the kiwi-kani roll. The kiwi roll was fantastic. It was full of blue crab; tightly rolled; and had a sweet and salty balance I love. ------We also had the curry duck. We were expecting a Thai type of entree with a large amount of sauce. Instead; it was a sliced breast with a curry marinade and some awesome eggplant. Recommend. ------TL; DR: get the kiwi roll. Sit in Linda's section. Enjoy if you can hear your table mates.
0,3,Wow what a pleasant surprise. Just moved to Charlotte this afternoon and decided to walk outside and grab a quick dinner when we stumbled into the soft opening of O-Ku. The wine pairing was great and slightly unusual in that we had South African and Oregon wines that were crisp; different (from the usual standards); and delicious. We split Spicy Edamame (yummy but not markedly unusual); Ceviche Tacos ( nice presentation and very flavorful); and Miso soup. For the main course we had the Mermaid Roll (fresh with a new twist); Potato Roll (the winner of the evening!!); and Curry Duck (large portion cooked perfectly with unusual type of eggplant). The service was excellent from the hostess; server Megan; and manager Justin. The ambiance was very nice in such an old eclectic building and the indirect lighting and lighting fixtures really set the tone for a cozy evening. They plan on having half price sushi happy hours Monday and Wednesday and we definitely plan on returning.  What a great evening. So happy to know that we can walk outside Ashton South End and enjoy such a nice (and healthy) evening. Thank you O-Ku!
0,3,The service was great and the food was delicious. We got the dumpling dim sum; Kiwi Kani Roll; Potato Roll; Salmon and Lemon Roll; and mango/chocolate Mochi. All were incredibly delicious. Monday and Wednesday are half price on all sushi rolls which is an incredibly good deal. I will definitely be coming back!
1,0,It was pretty much what I expected - high end ambiance to justify outrageous prices.  I knew this ahead of time so I waited until I had an opportunity to host a work dinner.  So this week I had a customer come to town and took him and my partner.  We went early (~5:30) because we were going to a hornets game afterwards.  I assumed I wouldn't need a reservation at that early hour but when we arrived the hostess said she could only seat us at the sushi bar.  I called her bluff and said we'd go somewhere else and the manager who happened to be standing next to her seated us at a table.  We ordered a some apps; which were good but teeny tiny; and the sushi was fine but I don't think I could take a pepsi challenge against any other sushi place in town if you took off the fancy presentation.  As expected with cocktails; sake; wine; and 3 hungry diners the bill was astronomical (and the rolls were half off!).  If you're looking to keep costs down stay away from the nigiri.  I'm not a sucker for high end experience and prefer a more casual environment.  Ru-san's is my favorite in Charlotte and I'd go there over this place any time.
1,3,Don't eat here unless you have a flashlight (lighting way too dim to read the menu); small appetite (portions might as well be kid size); and want to leave feeling dissatisfied. I had the Mermaid Roll; Salmon Lemon Roll; and Sake sashimi. The Mermaid Roll was decent at best; however the roll only had 4/5 individual tiny pieces. The Salmon Lemon Roll tastes like a Harris Teeter to go California Roll with salmon and lemon on top. The salmon in general was good quality; but was served warm. Right after eating at O-Ku; I went to a cheaper sushi place just to fulfill my appetite for larger portions at a better price. The hip atmosphere with its exposed brick and high tables could not compensate for my poor experience. Very disappointed since Charlotte Agenda highly recommend it.
1,3,Living in south Florida for 5 years has made me a sushi snob. I am originally Chicago and have lived there for a long time and Chicago also has excellent sushi restaurants. My husband and I recently moved to Charlotte and we have been on a hunt to find good sushi. It was a long journey and had several not so good sushi places before we found this one!!  You will not be disappointed with the quality of sushi. We had the spider roll; rainbow roll and tuna roll. For an app we had the ceviche tacos (please note these tacos are miniature size but very delicious). I also had the bourbon basil strawberry drink ( can't remember the name exactly) and it was delicious -- not too sweet; not too tart. And although this restaurant is very new and was very crowded for a Saturday night; the service was on point. We sat at the bar ( hour wait for a table) and all of the bartenders were super friendly and provided exemplary service. The hostess stand was equally friendly and as we were leaving they went out of their way to thank us for coming and say good bye.
1,3,1. Music is amazing ! Keep the old school rnb up!---2. Lobster poutine amazing but slightly salty ---3. Chicken wings were kinda small but tasty---4. Oysters were amazing. Must have when they're cheap ---5. Environment was cool. Cute waitresses
1,0,I ordered a soup from here and it was really small. I felt it was overpriced at $3.50 (if my memory serves me correctly); considering it didn't come with a bread roll and I still felt hungry when I left. ------The owner is a nice guy and the coffee is pretty good but I found another place that sells coffee nearby and it's almost half the price and just as good - bearing in mind I am happy with a good cup of filtered coffee.
1,3,Consistently say we're never coming back but it is my son's favorite restaurant so we cave sometimes...... but tonight is just the worse. My son has acknowledged that he has to wait until he's an adult to come back! ---Food quality has changed; portion sizes are smaller and the service?! Omg the service is just awful. I come in with a smile and leave biting my tongue and cursing under my breath. ---How has this continued on for so long is beyond me. My suggestion? Go to the Olive Tree next door - you will be glad you did!
1,0,Went here for sushi; we ordered the volcano dip as an appetizer. It was ok served with wafer crackers; as for the sushi we got the spicy tuna; Philly roll and the tempura shrimp. Both tuna and philly lacked flavor the tempura had a good flavor but overall the pieces were little and needless to say we had to make a mcdonalds stop on the way home. Good sushi just not enough for the price and flavor!
1,3,I have been coming here for 10+ years and never a bad experience. Sandy is the best server; fast friendly and funny. If you want a delicious treat try their weekly pot a bread. Also I love the Erica small plates which allows for us Weightloss patients to order in small portions!!! I will always remain a loyal customer for the next 10+ years!!!
1,0,Really good; quality hot dogs. However; very pricey for a small-ish meal. Also; not a ton of seating; which is kind of a downer. I would go back for a casual meal when I'm downtown.
1,0,I've been here 3 times now and each time I leave feeling dissatisfied. The chicken portions are small.  The sides are decent; like the fries. Their sides are nothing to write home about. They make a good sangria. The chicken I always get tends to be on the drier side.  Their sauces are what stands out at this place.  Other than that I'd rather cook my own chicken than pay the price at Nandos. I hope my friends don't drag me here again haha.
1,0,Love this place! Small portions so you can try more things and budget friendly! The food is good too and if you dont like whats on the revolving belt then you can order off of the menu! Will definitely be back!
1,0,Delicious fresh food. I absolutely love the quinoa lentil soup. It has the best flavor! I'm a little disappointed about serving sizes. I ordered the soup to go and when I got home it was about 1/2 a cup. I've also ordered half of sandwich and when I got home to eat it there was approximately 1 Tbs of tuna on the bread. ---I hope those situations were out of the ordinary and not the standard practice for orders that are "to go".
3,0,The Curry Chicken Roti is my favourite dish. It comes with some tasty coleslaw and apple chutney. Coupled with some red stripes and you have a great meal.
3,0,My boyfriend and I went last night for dinner and this time we brought a friend! The service from the minute you walk in the door to the minute you get sat was exceptional! The atmosphere was great and everyone was so welcoming! We got sat right away and our waiter came rather quickly with our drinks. We tried the southend shrimp; salmon tartar; and the yellowtail carpaccio for appetizers. Let me tell you they were delicious!! The shrimp was my favorite. If you love spicy that is the way to go!! For entrees we got the uni pasta; chicken teriyaki and the mermaid roll! We were stuffed. Not only were they delicious but they were very satisfying. The manager came to our table and introduced himself. He gave us the appetizers on the HOUSE. It was unreal. They really do take good care of their customers. We loved it and will definitely come back but with a larger crowd for sure!
3,1,I just go here for the confident girls that were fake tans; big boobs and little shorts really really well. Its a chill joint. very noisy food is big and fattening beer is ice cold. if you want fun and easy go here. its a chill bar but the crowd here is business men on lunch and tourists so people are cleaned up a bit. not a roll out of bed joint------I always get great service; they care about your driving ability after a few dirty blonde's (house beer) ------First impression is great everyone must go at least one and attended on at least one major holiday!
3,1,We came here just because we saw it on Undercover Boss.  We don't have Twin Peaks in California; so we wanted to try it out.  ------Over all; our visit was ehhh; not so great.  The place is more like a sports bar rather than a restaurant.  Lots; and lots of TV's; really noisy; but a good place for a bunch of guys to hang out I guess. ------The service was less than ok.  Our waitress  was not very attentive; didn't seem interested in waiting on us at all.  Maybe because my husband and I came a child; rather than being a group of guys.  There were two tables full of guys less than five feet away from us.  She probably checked on them every five minutes; while we only saw her but two times our whole visit; she took our drink and appetizer order; and brought us our check.  Someone else came and served our food.  She was more interested in visiting with the two groups of guys than actually doing her job.  Or maybe that is job; to only be attentive to the large groups of men entering this establishment; as this place is definitely geared toward "sex sells".------Anyway; we were here to have dinner.  We started with an appetizer; which was the pulled pork nachos.  We came with an appetite.  We planned to order dinner; but after the nachos came; there was seriously no need.  The nachos could literally feed five people.  Definitely worth $8.50.  They were really good!  A little different.  I've never had pulled pork in my nachos before.  But good nonetheless.------So; if you plan to come here; and want good service; make sure the majority of your group is of the adult MALE species.  They won't look at you twice if not.  If it wasn't for the good food; I would have only given one star.  If this is how Twin Peaks operates; I won't ever come back.  There are definitely a ton of better places to go to in Scottsdale.
3,0,Very surprised by the Greek Salad with grilled chicken. Good portion and the flavors between the kale; artichokes and capers etc worked very well. The local Kiltlifter is worth trying if you like Scottish style ales. Bartender Shey and manager Danny were attentive and took care of the patrons.
3,1,We took the 55 bus to Schwartz's. Upon arriving we had no idea how Schwartz's ordering worked so we waited in line. After 15 minutes in line we realized that if you are taking sandwiches to go that you don't have to wait in the line outside. Just walk in and place your order. Soooo; after waiting for 15 minutes we figured we would wait for a table. ------While waiting for the table we smelled a terrible sewage/garbage smell coming from a alley area directly connected to Schwartz. This totally ruined our appetites but we still waited. After 25 minutes our party of 4 was seated. We ordered the 1lb smoked meat platter for about 15 bucks. It comes with meat and bread. ------The smoked meat has a good flavor to it. It is spiced differently than Katz Deli and I really don't believe you can compare the two. Schwartz smoked meat is different from pastrami. I will say that when I visit Montreal again I will probably skip Schwartz if there is a line.  It is good but not worth a 25 minute wait and I could find comparable or better meats here in NYC.
3,1,I skipped the line and just got a 1/4 pound of meat and a small side of coleslaw at the deli counter. I would have had a sandwich; but the day was early and I wanted to save room for other spots on my list. Also; it's a bit hard to go to a Schwartz's when you are traveling with a vegetarian friend. Meat was delicious and just the right amount of fat. Seriously falls apart; which is slightly comical when you're siting on a bench trying fork some into your mouth; horrifying your non-meat eating friend with your carnivours ways. Coleslaw was great; nice and crisp which cut through the fat taste in my mouth.
3,0,I think if you're to go to any restaurant in Montreal to get a taste of the city you need to go to Schwartz's. I remember coming here a while back during the day time and having a fantasticly huge smoked meat sandwich. Thankfully; one of the best things about Schwartz's is that you can get yourself one of these bad boys at pretty much any time of day. So when I needed my midnight snack I knew I had to come here. ------Ok first of all I don't even like smoked meat. Except here; of course. Anywhere else I can't do it. So I ordered 2 medium smoked meat sandwiches; 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 half sours. Sadly they were out of half sours so I ordered a regular pickle.Despite there being a line (even at 12AM); the service was polite and efficient. Just a reminder; these guys are cash only; but theres an ATM in the back. For the 4 sandwiches+pickle it came to $36; pricey I guess; but totally worth it. I realized I forgot my cherry coke on the way out which was plain silly.------The meat was a bit dry. It wasn't moist and delicious like the first time I had it; perhaps because it was at night? Perhaps there was more fat on it the first time? Either way; it was still so huge it was nearly impossible to eat; and the amazing spices were all there so it still tasted great.  The pickle was also great; if you haven't had a pickle that isn't from a jar you bought at the grocery store; you need to. I don't know why they're so much better but they are. The turkey was also exceptionally good; but it was a cold cut; still it was seasoned wonderfully and also nearly impossible to eat like the smoked meat one. Also they threw in a few extra pickles for me! Yay-------1 point for the meat being dry. I'm sure it was an isolated incident ! :) Can't wait to be back.
3,0,Only been here once for lunch but it was delicious. I had a $4.99 lunch special; and it was amazing. A very large portion and the veggies weren't overcooked at all. It was perfectly spiced and the brown rice was perfectly cooked. I also had a veggie spring roll; which was delicious too. For the price; I don't think it could have been beat. The atmosphere was lovely as well and the food came out very quickly. The service was very good too. A great lunch spot!
3,1,So my Asian-persuasion boyfriend and I are on a quest to find decent Chinese food on the West side. I dragged him away from his favorite; Hunan of Solon; this summer because I just couldn't stand living on the East side anymore! So now that I am the Wicked Witch of the West (pun intended) I vowed to find him a place that would do his beloved Mongolian Beef dish justice. Up until this week I was failing miserably. Then one night on the way home from work I suggested we stop at the Pearl of the Orient. I hadn't been there in ages; but I remember my parents always saying good things about the food there. The restaurant is very small; I would guess no more than 15 tables in the joint; but decorated nicely. We were there late on a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty; but I'm not sure I would risk going on a weekend night and having to wait a while for a table to open up. We started off with an order of the braised potstickers and soup. The potstickers themselves were good; but the sauce served with them was very tart and vinegary. I thought it was a little overwhelming and didn't compliment the dish very well. The wonton soup was just OK. Not the best I have ever had and it was only luke warm when served to me. I was a little nervous going into the main course. I was so sure that the Mongolian Beef would once again not meet the expectations of the BF. It was served and he noticed the bean sprouts and carrots right away. "Not traditional"; he said and I just rolled my eyes and groaned. Here we go again. He took a bite; chewed thoughtfully and said "but still the best I've had on the West side". WOO HOO!!!! +1 for me!!!! I ordered the Honey Walnut Chicken and was happy with the large pieces of quality chicken breast; however the sauce was a little too thick and sweet for my liking. But I didn't care because I think we found our new West side "regular" Chinese joint! ------A few things to mention: ----On Monday nights they have a special of buy one chicken dish; get one for $1. What a steal! ----They offer you the choice of white or brown rice - nice to have options ----The soy sauce they serve is not your normal Kikomans. It has a thicker consistency and is WAY stronger. Seriously people; a drop of this stuff goes a long way.
3,0,We have come in to Pearl of the Orient multiple times. The reason I give it three stars is because it is always a bit different because of who ever is cooking in the back. Some of the cooks are better then the others. ------The food is delicious; the sushi is great (takes a little long to make so be ready to wait) and the main dishes are large enough to share. ------The service is very nice and everyone is helpful explaining things on the menu. It is a quitter atmosphere and I rarely see the bar completely filled but if you want some good Chinese; then this is definitely better then any takeout you have had.
3,0,We've been coming to The Pearl for more than a quarter century; so I figured it's time to post a review.------This is a favorite of our family. Food is always very good; portions are more than fair; and service is always friendly. Their pot stickers are the best we've had anywhere. Sushi is good too; but can be a bit slow to get to the table.------The owner is a great man who always visits tables to check on his customers.
3,0,We enjoyed a sold dinner here this week. Tried some sushi and a chicken dinner. Enjoyed wonton soup and split a non- noteworthy egg roll. ---Spicy tuna roll was delicious- lots of tuna and not overly mixed with spicy mayo or over-rocked. Will definitely go back for it since there is NO sushi in this area unless you count Heinens!!! ---The eel and cucumber was also delish. My hubs loves eel and he totally enjoyed this one. ---We split the bourbon chicken- it was nice but not really something notable. ---Overall I think this is a solid spot for sushi and I would give it another spin for sure. Service was great and the place was pretty busy on a weeknight. ---I also took into account the fact that they do specials! Love that and makes it a nice option for a weeknight dinner.
3,0,I will definitely be going back here! I love the fusion menu and the decor is kitschy but cute. Their noodle dishes are huge but their salads are the perfect size and not overwhelmed with random toppings.
3,0,I dont know how someone can write an entirely positive review and still give only a 3 stars. This place is amazeballs. The specials are cheaper than the elgin mills location that is closer to me. The cornmeal on the pizza bottom is soooooo guuuuuuuud. Wings are just delish; they toss it in sauce after theyre ready. The bacon honey mustard sauce is *high pitched voice* to diiiiieeee for. They are smaller wings but meat is always juicy and skin is flavourful. Marinara sauce is $1 and is a GENEROUS portion. Wait time is less than pizza pizza too. No seating; take out only.
3,0,This place is very cool!  Great 50's diner vibe with booths; jukeboxes; funky old signs and art.  Service was mostly friendly and efficient and the food was pretty darn good.  One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had!  Big portions.  Huge step up from your regular fast food joints; $13.00 veggie combo; while it appears pricey; is actually pretty fair for the quality/quantity you get.  Call me a fan!
3,1,Big portion and inexpensive; but there is where the pluses end.  I ordered dry pho with grilled chicken and spring rolls.  The chicken tasted dated and on the brink of going bad.  The spring rolls were very crunchy (good) but the meat inside tasted dated; too.  The noodle was okay though.
3,0,Clean; quirky hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant.  Definitely authentic (they serve Menudo on weekends).  Reminds me of those great little Burrito places where you can get a bite to eat at 3am after drinking. ------Oh wait; you can do that here too!  Whoohoo! =)------Carne Asada tacos + rice + refried beans = great alternative to drive-thru after partying all night.  Everything is made to order.  They boast having the bigges burrito in Las Vegas.  The pictures look convincing.
3,1,Stopped in for lunch last week and was pleasantly surprised.---I split the steamed dumplings with a friend - tasty; but nothing made them especially stand out. The complimentary salad with ginger dressing and an eggroll was a nice touch and my Udon Noodle dish was delicious. For $8.50; I had a filling lunch; and enough left over to take home for dinner. I will definitely go again.
3,0,Fun place to eat out at. Burgers as promised are yum and big! I am yet to try the shakes.  Old American diner look and feel with great burgers! Like the place.
