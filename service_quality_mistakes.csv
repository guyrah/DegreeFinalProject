0,3,The service was great and the food was delicious. We got the dumpling dim sum| Kiwi Kani Roll| Potato Roll| Salmon and Lemon Roll| and mango/chocolate Mochi. All were incredibly delicious. Monday and Wednesday are half price on all sushi rolls which is an incredibly good deal. I will definitely be coming back!
0,3,I think my colleague said it best when he stated| "you come here for the peaks and not the food". They have a really cool system that almost freezes the beer and shows the temperature it is being poured at. The food here is nothing special. I recommend not getting to adventurous as your will probably be disappointed. I had the nachos and wings and they taste okay. I really only come to this place for one reason. The UFC!!! The atmosphere for the fights is unbelievable and the staff does a great job with the busyness. All in all a nice sports bar with a uniquely dressed staff that I am sure attracts some regulars
0,3,Excellent place to watch the game.  Servers abound wearing lumberjack tops and short shorts.------Miniscule bar menu for food.  The fish tacos were good.  Lots of drinking options.  ------Most of the tables are "tall" and there are a few booths.------Nice looking place inside.------Great place to go for a beer.
0,1,Ambiance is great! But it all goes down hill from there!------Went twice just to give them a second shot!------I had the Wilcox burger ' not much flavor and it was $17.00------Also ordered the southern fried chicken and it was not cooked. ---------Waitress told me it was their brining process!
0,1,When I got to the place i was given a table for 4 but i had 6 people with me and to order our food it took about 45 min to an hour---Ordering drinks was quiet fast but food service was extremely slow.---the menu looked amazing and i was excited to try the food especially the duck confi wings and sliders.---After waiting about 45 min to an hour we finally got our food and it was extremely under seasoned the food lacked taste| it was almost bland| hopefully they fix it because i was extremely disappointed paying 20 dollars for one meal and receiving something that tasted like cardboard.---I do not recommend this place.---over priced for low end food with fancy names
0,3,I have been eating at this restaurant for at least 25 years now.  I have always had consistently good| friendly service and fresh| well seasoned food.  ------Some note-ables:  Love the Tom Yum Goong soup| actually all of the soups are good.  They will make the sushi with brown rice when requested| which is always a good option.  The Young Chow fried rice is a favorite as is the Beef and Broccoli.  You also can't go wrong with the Pad Thai| Szechuan Chicken| Spicy Pork or Crunchy Beef.---The only recent complaint I had was with the Yuen Baos.  This was always my favorite place to get them.  They were large and filled with soft creamy cheese and plenty of crab flavor.  However| the last order seemed like a freeze and thaw version and were very small and dried out in the middle.  The server was apologetic and did remove them from our bill. --- ---The atmosphere is warm and welcoming and I highly recommend this restaurant.  ------Oh....I also wish they would bring back the "tasting dinners" they used to host 20-some years ago| which featured an array of offerings not on the regular menu and served family style at large round tables.  We always met nice people and shared great food at these events.
0,1,stay AWAY from this place| I overheard the owner of this place telling his employees to use up the rotten fruits and expired bubble tea powder first. Not to mention the owner| a short hong Kong man| was super rude to his employees. What's even more shocking was my friend said she saw employees trying to get rid a cockroach inside the kitchen while we were waiting for our drinks *vomits*. We through away the drinks as soon as we left the shop. Their drinks are especially good| so added with the gross experience| I'd rather take money elsewhere
0,3,From my Veggie Chronicles on Facebook. It's hard to evaluate LOVE! ------Nature Burger @ LICKS:----Fresh toppings: lettuce| onions| cucumbers| tomatoes| hot peppers| relish| olives| ketchup| bbq sauce and mustard----Patty: juicy| soft| tasty| thick----Price: ~$5 after taxes (just the burger)----Verdict: it was completely satisfying. Skip the cheese and mayo for a vegan option. Ask for a whole wheat bun for a healthier alternative (but I think they come standard). Licks' veggie burgers will never disappoint!------FYI| I'm not evaluating the restaurant| although I've never really cared about the service. C'mon| it's fast food people| what kind of service do you actually expect? You order the burger| name your toppings| they put the toppings on for you| you grab your burger and chow down. It's not like a 5-star restaurant where you can actually expect excellent service| it's part of the 5-star dining experience!
0,3,Ahh| Chick-fil-a!  Back when I lived in San Francisco| I could not believe they were so far away from the city.  Such elusive yet delectible fried chicken should not be kept far from the masses!---This chick-fil-a is in the mall| but still good.  Don't forget: this is Cleveland| so you pay less if you tell them the order is to go| rather than to eat in the mall.  I still don't understand that little piece of logic.---A full service Chick-fil-a with breakfast| although you cannot get it until 9am.
0,3,We live very close to the Harp and have always gone here with family to eat at dinner| the food is great.  A night they have live bands.  In the afternoon it's a great place to go after work or with your kids for a quiet family outing.  I don't recommend it for kids after dinner as it is a bar| but in the early afternoon we have always gone and the staff are great with to our kids and make them laugh all the time.
0,3,Somehow they decided it was okay to automatically autograt drinks and then below that add a line that says Tip! The only reason I noticed was because my two vodka sodas managed to be $25.30 here! My friend ordered some sushi and rock shrimp dish which he said was pretty good and I ordered the Teriyaki chicken which lacked any type of excitement. It was boiled chicken with a basic teryaki sauce- knda laughable considering the price!  Not sure if I'd come here for the food as the entetainment and dancing by the staff made for a better experience.
0,1,Poor service and not prepared well.---That is the review ---Don't need to say much more---Sent steaks back 2 times.  ---And it is a steak place---Enough said
0,3,I liked this place| until I found hair in my sushi! Unacceptable!!!  Brought it up to the server| and was unresponsive| didn't even offer to take it off the check or anything. Very disappointed. Never going back!
0,3,Their other location on eglinton and tenth line is superior in quality| portions and service. However| this place is much better than most of the quick service Lebanese/shawarma places. Their portions are substantial!
0,1,Great restaurant in the Cosmopolitan hotel. I ordered the salmon burger| and was very pleasantly surprised by the taste and quality of my meal. The salmon was a smoked fillet| and it was nice to see the place didn't take the easy route by making a salmon patty. I had to ask the waiter to take the bucket of fries away because they were so good and I couldn't stop eating them.------The best part of my meal was sitting at the bar| and talking to the nice woman next me. Vegas is all about  new people| food| and experiences| and that's just what I got at Holsteins.
0,3,Everything at this restaurant is done right from appetizers to dessert.  Our favorite meal is "Just for the Halibut".  They have a great wine list and the servers know how to pair them very well.  The desserts are homemade so save room.
0,3,Unimpressed.------I had been wanting to try this place because I am a fan of Mike Trivisonno's radio show on WTAM 1100. I learned from our server that the place is owned by Mike's son| who is also named Mike. ------I had the French onion soup and a crab cake sandwich. The soup was good. The atmosphere of a restaurant influences how the food tastes. I'll elaborate: the soup was good| but not as good as French onion I've had at another place recently--the other place had a warmer| cozy environment. Triv's by contrast| had a cold| dull| almost generic feeling. The bowl the soup was in was not visibly affected by the cheese in the soup to the extent that the cheese stuck to it (which would indicate that the soup was not| say| microwaved to cook the cheese over the top of the bowl). I mention this because in a better bowl of French onion soup| the cheese should be and would be charred to the bowl| indicating that it was baked in an oven| as opposed to microwaved. I realize I'm being nit-picky. But it's important. ------On to the crab cake sandwich: it was a grade below so-so. ------A note about my friend's meal: she ordered the "special of the day." Unfortunately she reported to me and our server that she could not detect too much that was special about the meal. It was fish--I think walleye| with pasta. The fish was reportedly very plain and the pasta was average--with some parmesan and maybe butter or olive oil. In other words| her meal was almost the *opposite* of special.
0,3,Excellent service on Tuesday night for a large group meeting.  Just had tomato basil soup but it was great! Reisling wine to top it off!  Restroom needed to have the diaper changer table safety belt replaced.
0,3,We were in last weekend| and it was not great. The food itself was pretty good| however there were some other issues. It took forever to get our order| and when we did it was incomplete. They had forgotten my daughter's meal. This is the second time in a row at this location we've experienced very slow service and a forgotten meal. Also| there were cockroaches crawling around| and when I let the manager know he didn't seem to care.
0,3,Amazing atmosphere| and great food! It has a nice modern updated look| kind of like a modern diner. Also has a terrasse and televisions with trending live sports. As a kosher restaurant| it is comparitively cheap but some items are somewhat pricey| like their asian dishes. Overall the portions are generous| and the quality is good. Service can take some time| but it is worth the wait in the end. If I could recommend some of their dishes| it would be the mergez baguette| shish taouk laffa or a classic shawarma pita. As for their sauces| I like their creamy and tangy burger sauce| and their insanely spicy sauce if you're up to it.
0,3,Great salads for a bagel shop! Fresh and full of a variety of vegetables. Their tuna salad is much better than average. ------Try the Tombstone Wrap if your in the mood. It looks delicious! Big enough for 2 meals. ------Friendly and fast service. ---BYW I love the new tables!---Thanks Nosh.....we'll be back.
0,3,I came here with my wife to satisfy a late night korean bbq craving| but truly fell for their incredible side dishes. The kim chi is delightfully spicy| and complements the massive amounts of meat available at a reasonable price. Service was prompt as well| but the restaurant wasn't too busy at the time. Highly recommended!
0,3,Where do i start ? Prepackaged pancakes or frozen french toast triangles.maybe its best to start at the mug of mud... I mean coffee. After dropping 40$ for my wife and i we were very disappointed and shocked at how subpar this breakfast buffet was. food quality is what i'd imagine prison food tastes like. The 2 stars are for the delicious orange juice(after the waiter finally brought it to us) along with the delicious bacon. I highly recommend any fastfood joint over this place. Im not sure how lunch or dinner is but luckily wont have to find out.
0,3,Hey guys. Today was my 3rd time in the shop. I'm really bummed out. Every visit| I've ordered the Barry B. with avocado. "We call it the 786..it's just the Barry B. with avocado. It saves you a couple cents" is what you all say. I appreciate you looking out for me| except for the fact that I've received avocado on my sando 0/3x. I used to work at Bunk sandwiches in Oregon; I know what it's like to work at a sandwich shop| so regardless of service| I tip $2.00 per sandwich..so c'mon. For the love of god| please put avocado on my fkn sandwich because I'm paying for it :( :( :(   you're killing me.------Other than that| this place is decent. Pricey| but understandable for a gourmet sandwich joint.------Ike's NO love and sandwiches :(
0,3,Wow and wow again! I loved this place!! Definitely was my favorite spot when I visited Phoenix. I think everyone should come here if they visit or even pass through. Totally worth it! Excellent margaritas and fast friendly service. And they serve elote!! The whole restaurant is made out of an old church so the decor and architecture go with that theme. Loved my time here. The food was excellent! I loved how they had old world and new world tacos lined out on their menu. So you can get carnitas and pastor but also duck! All decked out with different kinds of veggies and salsas. So rad! They have an amazing queso dip and their guacamole was perfect! I will most definitely come back to this cool spot the next time I'm in town!
0,1,Subs are good.  Reason I gave a 3 star is because I feel the customer service and time can step it up.  Second time I have been here and both times they are very slow at making the subs.  ------Tonight I walked in and order 3 subs.  I am the only customer in the joint.  4 employees working.  I place my order.  After I place my order| the cashier goes and sweeps|one gal starts to make the subs| another employee is cleaning the counter along the back wall and another is doing something else.  One would think that maybe another employee would stop what they were doing to help make 3 subs.  Nope| left it up to the girl and she was very slow.  A few other people walk in and order and then another employee starts on their subs.  Mind you| my order is still not complete.------I think I will stick with Subway next time.  More options| less expensive. Faster service and it still fills me up.
0,3,I should have listen to the reviews. I normally don't write reviews| but this place really stinks. I was hesitant to go after reading the reviews| but I figured I give it a try for myself. I sat at the bar and ordered some fried calamari as an appetizer and a salad as my main course. The calamari took forever and when I received| it was overcooked.  After another 20-30 minutes I asked about my salad and it was never made. This is probably the worst dining I've had in Vegas| I should have just ate at a food court and gotten better service and better food:
0,3,Went to Hoops just before a Jays game. Was really hungry| so I ordered a slam dunk burger. Umm.. No.---There was no flavour. Even with the bacon and cheese| still bland and not worth the price.  ---Some of my coworkers had their poutine| which they said was pretty good---The wait staff were great| however they might want to check id.---Turns out one of my coworkers was underage and was served alcohol.
0,3,Very friendly service.  The duck with red curry is the best. Duck is crispy on the outside juicy on the inside. The curry is full of flavor. Be careful of your spice level I ordered level 8 and was pouring sweat but didn't want to stop eating because it was SOOO good. My favorite place to eat
1,0,OMG... talk about bait and switch...------They build a whole new building and cut both the staff and the hours!------They don't know what to do with 2 ordering lanes... we have given up and started going to Steels Corner... such a shame!!
1,0,Slowest.......McDonald's........ever.  Do not| I repeat| DO NOT come here if you think you're going to just waltz through here on your way to work.  You'll be better off stopping at the farm to pick up your ham| eggs| and cheese to make your own McMuffin.  This is newly remodeled with two drive-thru lanes| which is hilarious considering they were ten times faster when they had just one.  I have been here on about four separate occasions that I can remember| three being drive-thru| and I have (not exaggerating in the least) waited 10-15 minutes every single time.  Of these four times not once did I go during a peak busy hour and sometimes I was the only one in line.  Not sure what they're doing in there but it definitely isn't fast...
1,0,I've been to the new and improved layout twice now| and twice now its taken forever to get food.  This time it took 15 minutes to get my food at 10pm at night.  To boot| they put my large sweet tea in a cup with a hole in the bottom.  Made a huge mess on me and the car.  Just drive further down to the Steels Corner McD's where they have their act together.
1,0,Only rating this based off my experience there last night. Didn't get to try any fooWas wanting to try this after eating at O-Ku in Charleston. The weather was perfect last night| a Wednesday| so a wait anywhere around 7 was expected. I called ahead and asked what the wait would be. The hostess let me know that we would be one of the first to be seated. I asked how many minutes that would take and she said it all depends on when we get there and they will assess. We got there within 10 minutes. The hostess said it was a 20 minute wait. Odd| since on the phone she said we would be one of the first seated. I felt like they baited us into coming in to wait. After over 20 minutes I asked how much longer and she said we'll be seated soon and that parties that came in after us had reservations. 10 minutes later| they seat our party of 3 at the bar. We asked for a table and she said there's a wait for a table and that there's 7 groups ahead of us for a table. Over the phone we were one of the first to be seated and w. We just left and went to Futo Buta instead. Don't appreciate how we were lied to from the get go. We shouldn't have stuck around.
1,0,Lack of service at the bar. It took us 15 minutes to take bartender attention. Wines are over price.---And their food is ok.
1,0,Terrible experience.  Was seated promptly and we sat at our table for 45 minutes without a one server coming to our table to take an order or even ask is how we were doing.  Had to walk up to the bar to get a beer and the place was half empty.  Had two beers without seeing a waitress at our table one time.  Truly dismal.  This place seems far more impressed by the temperature of their beer than they are with customer service.  Avoid at all costs.
1,0,Wow| ordered a burrito and asked for a cup of water.  Response:  sorry| no cup for water.  Can I get my tip back?  Too many other places for my biz.  Go to El Pollo Loco next door.------Added one to the one star cuz the burrito was ok| needs sauce though.
1,0,We took the 55 bus to Schwartz's. Upon arriving we had no idea how Schwartz's ordering worked so we waited in line. After 15 minutes in line we realized that if you are taking sandwiches to go that you don't have to wait in the line outside. Just walk in and place your order. Soooo| after waiting for 15 minutes we figured we would wait for a table. ------While waiting for the table we smelled a terrible sewage/garbage smell coming from a alley area directly connected to Schwartz. This totally ruined our appetites but we still waited. After 25 minutes our party of 4 was seated. We ordered the 1lb smoked meat platter for about 15 bucks. It comes with meat and bread. ------The smoked meat has a good flavor to it. It is spiced differently than Katz Deli and I really don't believe you can compare the two. Schwartz smoked meat is different from pastrami. I will say that when I visit Montreal again I will probably skip Schwartz if there is a line.  It is good but not worth a 25 minute wait and I could find comparable or better meats here in NYC.
1,0,I gotta say their smoked meat sandwich and pickle is delicious| sooo good.------However the place is shabby and small| often there's a lineup| and it's so warm in there that I question its sanitary condition :/ i see the dude cutting up the meat drenched in sweat... Doesn't reassure. Don't stare at the meat either| looks weird| greasy and just unappetizing if you're used to a lean clean diet.------If you like that dirty New York experience| go for it.
1,3,We were not impressed and will never go to Pearl of the Orient again. My dinner arrived lukewarm and under cooked. The worst thing about dining there was Food Poisoning. I felt sick to my stomach while I was eating. It hit me fast and I needed to leave right away. I mentioned to the waiter I wasn't feeling well and he just ignored that fact. It was a rough night. However I am glad that I didn't finish my food because I would have been in worse shape. I called the next day and spoke to the owner who just blew me off which is surprising. Food poisoning is serious bottom line.
1,3,American Chinese food. The schezuan style is not authentic here just as a heads up.  It's cooked in a tangy Americanized type suace instead of hot oil and red peppers. I've never had a curry taste so sticky/syrupy even with a coconut milk base. $16 for two small soft shell crab was kind of pricey in my opinion.------My waiter was clueless...wasn't very helpful or attentive. I was served a sushi roll of white tuna when I had asked for a sashimi dish as an appetizer.   He took it back| but I ended up waiting until after our dinner was done (30 minutes later) for me to tell him to cancel it altogether. Really disappointing.
1,0,I went here today for food for the first time and I was disappointed. First| we waited far too long to be served| everyone else around us had service| but it took forever for someone to finally notice that no one had asked us if we wanted even a drink. Then I ordered a veggie wrap| with salad. When it came| I was given half salad| half fries| so I had to have it fixed. Then the salad was drenched in dressing| so much so that I had to blot it with my napkin. And my wrap was dripping with oil| again - blotting with my napkin. When I got the bill I was charged extra for the half and half fries| that I didn't ask for in the first place. Doubt I'll return.
1,3,I like this place a lot but the waitress was having a bad hair day and totally spoiled the meal. So sadly i have marked it down from four stars to three.
1,3,Have you ever had the feeling like your wife might be slipped something while ordering a drink| or molested on the way to the can? That is how I felt while celebrating a birthday here. ------The place was down right creepy. ------Don't get me wrong| I love me a dive bar. I can eat on the curb in Mexico. I am a very trusting person. ------I hated this place. ------The drinks were ok| ther servers were not attentive| the decor and outside sitting area was cool.
1,3,....ambience great..great food.. service well not so much...wine list really!!!!---.the waitress had great personality and a wonderful attitude ...however she just didn't know how to be a server ....---so 5 stars when you train your staff.....and figure out the wine list....
1,0,Skip this one| and go to the one up the road (Val Vista) near Home Depot.  Could be the same owners| for all I know.------This one is dirty and will screw up your order every time.  But they make up for it by serving it COLD!  They just don't care.------We've been there several times| as we live across the street.  (We get lazy and think| "Well| maybe they're better now."  Nope| still sucks.
1,3,I wasn't really into this place. The menu isn't all that great| the service was unfriendly and the bacon cheeseburger I had was "just okay". At least my drink was cold...---I don't think I'll be coming back.
1,0,Can't review this restaurant because when I sat down a rude French woman told me since I was only one person I couldn't sit at a table and had to sit at a solitary barstool wedged into a corner. I then left.
1,3,it's starbucks and i love starbucks| but the girl behind the counter was rude to me and it was only just past 7am.  so sorry| lothian road starbucks you only get three stars.  maybe you should teach your staff how to be nice| especially to early morning customers on their way to work!!!
1,0,The lady at the counter was rude. Food portions are snack size. Hot rod theme that is a lame attempt at being cool. Nothing to brag about | which stinks because I like supporting independent food joints. This has been a disappointment 3 times in a row| you're out !
1,0,This was a terrible experience!  I called in my order ahead of time| which they had not made as I arrived to pick up my order.  We had to wait at least 10 minutes and then they skimped out on the order.  I did not check it| as I left| as I needed to leave| but found as I was on my way home| that I did not receive half of my order!  I called and asked about some of my order and was told that| yes| tortillas do come with fajitas!  I arrived back at the restaurant and asked the accompaniments be added to my order| as i did not receive them| which I did receive.  Really| it is that hard to provide what is on the menu to your customer!!
1,3,Food was alright| its Burger king so you should know what you are getting| nothing bad it was decent. On the plus side this location is large and pretty clean|  staff could use a bit work in customer service but it was alright------Took the guy at cash a bit of time to notice me but other then that no issue with my order------Also| 10 nuggets for 1.99 is back
1,0,Normally I enjoy ordering from here| however this particular evening| it took an hour and a half to deliver| my food was cold| and parts of it burned| and they forgot my salads| which is where they put the little dish of tzatziki in| so I had to eat dry| burned chicken. ---On top of that| it took an hour for them to deliver the salads again. ---After paying $35.00 for 2 meals| and a good tip to the idiot delivery guy| not impressed.---And on top of all that| no one at the restaurant apologized| neither did the delivery guy. Really disappointing.
1,3,This place was dead when we arrived.  Nothing changed in the 2 hours or so that we were there.  We had the tasting menu and it was good but not great.  The service was good but slow beyond words.  We asked to pack our dessert and take it back to the room because we were getting tired of sitting there for so long.  With so many culinary options in Vegas| Table 10 needs to step up it's game!
1,3,I really enjoyed this place| and I'm giving just 3 stars for 3 reasons: 1. Limited vegetarian options| and my sweetheart is a vegetarian; 2. Limited gluten-free options (hint: serving a sandwich without bread doesn't really count); and 3. Our waitress knew very little about the menu. ------That said| the steak special was delicious. The deviled eggs and Devils on horseback were also quite tasty. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals| and service was responsive and friendly. The chicken wings looked fantastic but very sticky. I sampled the calamari| and it was beautifully prepared. ------It was a pleasant atmosphere with comfy seating. Oddly| the music was at a good level for conversation when we arrived| but was turned up in the middle of the meal| making conversation harder.
1,0,Slow service!  Lots of waitress conversating! BBQ sauce remains outstanding! Meat came out cold! Beans  just average! Not feeling none of the sides!---Start over FD!
1,0,Sat down for 15 minutes today at the sushi bar.  There were 4 people working and no one even acknowledged my existence| asked if I was picking up an order or if I'd like something to drink.  3 people walked in and either picked up call-in orders or placed an order| had it fulfilled.  I sat there watching| made eye contact with two of the people working| and still no one spoke to me.  After 15 minutes| I left and will never go back.
1,3,UGH!| I don't even know where to start. But I came for lunch around 11:45a and why| there was a nice welcome... well that was the end of it!. We sat down pretty quickly but it wasn't until around 12:10-12:15 when we finally got our drinks and finally placed our orders| in the end after having 3 waiters and having to stand up countless of time to ask about our food (chicken wings| Sandwich and a turkey wrap )| we finally received out food. Which included COLD! fries and under-cooked chicken wings. Needless to say I was completely disappointed with the experience| but I will DEFINITIVELY NOT return to this place.
1,3,It's a pretty nice place since they upgraded it| but I have not actually eaten here yet. Just drinks! The service is mediocre| which is why I gave it a 3| but the white peach margarita is phenomenal| so I highly recommend it!
1,0,Food was so bland| veggies weren't cooked| waitress nvr came by 2 check on us we had 2 keep calling over another waitress| our food was mixed up...they put my sides in my pasta instead of on the side like it's suppose 2 b... very disappointed. ..after we complained her solution was ok i won't charge u for the soda...seriously... this place has gone 2 hell... 2 years ago it was the spot...
1,0,Kept driving by this place on my way home from work so made reservations to try it out.  The good things: adobo chicken and broccoli salad.  The awesome thing: dessert in the funky bowl.  The really crappy thing (and this is not entirely the restaurant's fault): The obnoxious patrons who were sitting us who completely ruined our dining experience.  For the price of the food| as good as it was| not sure the place was for me.
1,3,Love the other angry crab| but the mesa location is bad. Service isn't good| atmosphere is not like the other locations and the good doesn't taste the same. Avoid this location.
1,0,The food was a 4.  Tastes good and LOTS of it!  However| our service was a 3.  Our waitress was not very organized and we had to keep asking for things.  It's a good place| but not sure I will go back.  Maybe to another one.
1,3,This place is a hole in the wall. My niece goes there regularly  so we decided to try it . The staff was not that friendly. Prices are reasonable.  We tried their pro with steak and brisket . The portion  was large but the soup did not have much flavor. The meat was very fatty and not much meat. Also tried their fried rice . It was oily and the pork was overcooked.  We did like their  desert macro on with ice cream. Food came quickly.
1,0,If you like getting insulted by the bartenders for your beverage choices| then you could give this place 2 stars.  I switch to pop or water if I know I'm going to be leaving soon and need to lose the buzz| and you would think bartenders would be a little understanding of people not wanting to drink and drive.  Of course| the male bartenders wear shirts that say "Party like a pinata - get smashed" and the female workers hardly wear anything at all.  If you have a low IQ and/or high testosterone levels| then this is probably a good choice for you.  I will never return.
1,0,The pizza here is mediocre. The sauce has very little flavor and I couldn't even taste the pepperoni. Plus when I recently talked with Greg the owner he was unfriendly on the phone and then hung up on me rudely. For my money Rossi's pizza down the road is far better. The pepperoni is flavorful and the sauce has that kick you can only get from Chicago style sauce. Plus the guys that work there are friendly. I would only recommend this place if you need a pizza on Monday night since Rossi's is closed that night.
1,0,The donuts here are amazing- unsure of their management. I stopped in to get a gift card for a friend one evening. The lady at the register was very helpful. Then her manager stepped in and was incredibly rude to her and me. Left a bad taste in my mouth.------Not something I normally see here. Go and get the maple bacon.
1,0,Just finished breakfast here. There are 4 customers here and our food took over 30 minutes to arrive. My order was wrong| they put the wrong veggies in my omelette. Hash browns are dry| generally uninspired breakfast. Save your money and eat at home.
1,0,Overpriced.------If you've been to Chipotle or Qdoba| then you know that this place isn't quite as good.  Maybe I was unlucky or maybe this co. needs to change their training procedure| but my bowl was a little on the skimpy side.  The person that helped me was clearly new since they asked the people around how much of veggies| beans| rice| meat| etc.  Because of that| mine was a little weak.------The chips are ultra-thin so feel especially oily.  I'll avoid Salsarita in the future--no need to tarnish the sterling brand that is Chipotle.------dmo out.
1,3,We came for brunch. I though the food was good - this place will be a nice| reliable go-to in the neighbourhood. I thought the server was rude and this really put a damper on the experience.
1,3,I was in 08/06/2016 and our server was Malory. The Brooklyn Family was delicious per usual and the Crispy Mozzarella was addicting. Food was and is always great here. Our service on the other hand was irritating and made me not want to come into this location again. She constantly interrupted us to push us to order and then boxed our pizza up when were still working on our first slice. She was not cut from her shift yet| she did not need our table for anyone waiting. She asked me 6 times for the payment in the space of 10 minutes. I did reach out Josh McGee per my receipt; I was never contacted. I love NYPD but I will not dine in this location again.
1,0,There is no AC in the store and it's 110 degrees outside. The employees can't manage to figure out how to make both smoothies and food at the same time| even though there's three of them. There is no sense of urgency and the wait is over 20 minutes.
1,0,One of the worst experience I have ever had. I had to wait 45 minutes for a smoothie. The manager| I am assuming because she was the one in yoga pants and on her cellphone| wasn't paying attention to anyone or any of the orders that were piling up. One of the workers walked out with three smoothies and never came back. The other two workers looked lost. I will never be returning to this place again.
1,3,The food is mostly tasty. The service is consistently poor. I frequently stop at all of their locations and have never come across a happy or kind employee. They always seem pissed off.  They do nickel and dime everything down to the amount of pickles hour aloud to put on a sandwich. I'll keep going for the food but the owner should maybe try some team building or infuse some positive energy into his employees.
1,0,I just made my first visit to this establishment and I can soundly say that I would rather stab myself in the face with a screw driver than eat here again. The food was illegally cold. I'm contacting the health department. I was given no napkins in the drive through and not offered sauce. The kid in the window looked at me like a crazy person when I asked for these things. Also| no receipt. I think I was over charged but can't prove it. Never again.
1,0,This location is nice and clean. But they got my order wrong not 2 but 3 times. I don't know it was like zombies were working there. Anyway I left. Never coming back to this location ever!
1,3,Very nice food.  Service is polite but they don't know the menu well. It is not my thing to order wine by a number.  Staff added tap water to sparkling water.  Nice apology but nothing more.  These big named restaurants do food on this scale amazingly well but they are too expensive for the service you get.
1,3,I come here every so often when I'm either craving pho or have a hangover from a party the night before.------Never truly had a GREAT experience but I always come back because of proximity as well as the quality of food. ------The exterior is not very appealing although they recently got a new door. Inside isn't much better considering there are wobbly tables held firm with cardboard. ------Customer service wise is unusual and uncomfortable. I am a very friendly person and smile often but if you can't simple have an upbeat tone and smile when seating or taking an order it's just weird.
1,0,Was not a pleasant experience. I went there for Valentines Day. I ordered a regular salad which was an okay price. The waitress asked me if I wanted just the salad or if I wanted to add chicken to it as well. She didn't mention any change in price when she asked this. When I got the check| the few pieces of chicken I did get added up to an additional $10 which was more than the actual salad itself. The chicken was also dried out and plain. I didn't even finish it because the salad was just not good after that. The total for my course alone was roughly $18 for regular lettuce and dried out chicken. Would not recommend and will not be back.
1,0,Came here to sit in the evening sun and enjoy my dinner. Was here 5 minutes and they dropped the blinds and took the sun away. I mentioned it and they said they were closing them all for the people inside. Yet| more than just me sat out there for thr sun (only 72 right now) and people were getting sweaters out of their cars. We left. Went elsewhere to sit in the sun and eat dinner.------Second time here....still not impressed. Maybe if the bartender would have been nicer.......
1,3,This place is so hit & miss| you never know what and when you will get your order. It's been 44 minutes and still waiting for a take out pizza.------I've been here before and it has never been this slow. Looks like the same staff but I have no idea what's going on in the kitchen.------I left and went for Indian instead.------A meal later and I am back for that pickup pizza. What? Still not ready? You've got to be kidding!------It took an hour to get a take out pizza! ------The worst part was the very RUDE woman who said I should call ahead of time! Excellent idea. I will call ahead next time but for delved and NOT from San Francesco!------On another occasion the crust was so burnt| not even the dogs would touch it
1,3,Wow! Stingiest McDonald I have ever been. You have to beg for ketchup and napkins.  The staff here are not friendly at all.  They don't even know how to fake a smile.
1,0,I always get my favourite thing on the menu here. The peri peri chicken sandwich and the potato wedges (my friend gets the mashed potatoes so we get the best of both). The service was BAD though| so slow and it took so long just to refill our waters. Other locations are better than this.
1,0,Incompetent workers that I cannot believe want a raise for doing such a piss poor job. I knew I should've checked my very simple when the simple worker took it. Hijack SOB can't tell their asses from a hole in the ground. Will NEVER be back.
1,0,We sat down three guys came in after us they were immediately given menus and drinks. 10 mins went by and no one EVEN acknowledged us. Until we made our way out the door| thanking us for coming. Even thanking us for coming.
1,0,I called in ahead of time to order our large sub so it would be ready when we got there upon arriving they told us they never received our order. To make sure we didn't call the wrong location we called the number I had just ordered from and the store we were just in answered so we walked back in and asked them to make out large hoagie. When it was finally ready they said they didn't have a large so they just made two smalls... Thanks for asking if that was ok. Worst caps experience! I'm still amazed that they could lose out order after they asked for a name and a call back number
1,3,Be warned if you order something like soulvaki it will take a bit longer since it is cooked fresh off the grill.  This place always has a line during the Taste of the Danforth festival.  Here they serve their gyros stuffed with fries (optional).  I came here for dinner - very busy.  Server was not very attentive during my visit.  Chicken soulvaki was a-okay.  My friend had the skewered shrimp.
1,0,I ordered breakfast here|  and the cashier got my order wrong|  I was dinning in and told him that |  but they gave me a to go bag. The soda machine was messed up|  every soda I choose was flat| not mention they were out of ketchup|  so plain hash brown for me and every other customer.  Stay away from this mcdonalds as I will.
1,0,I think it can be said that you do not go to the Flamingo for good food but I was staying here and my poor little feet could not take another step. ------I ordered a po' boy and boy was it poorly made and served. Our server switched mid-shift and never spoke a word to us about doing so. That's okay but then the next guy who served us was just rude and unfriendly. I would not have enjoyed my food if I did not have the crunkies.
1,0,Usually this is a go to spot once a month and I never have any issues but today's lunch was extremely disappointing ! The girl working clearly didn't want to be there today . She slops my herby turkey together annoyed | I asked for a pickle and she gives me one that's wilted and gross . I then asked for soup and she never got me the bagel bites to go with it .  Far from appetizing experience today .
1,3,This is the second time I have been here.  The first time| it was great.  Food was fabulous and the servers friendly. ... I decided to bring my husband.  After 10 minutes| I had ask for water and then we got a server.  It was not busy and the waitresses were just standing at the counter talking...Ugh!  Not so sure now that I will be back
1,0,Horrible experience!!! A large group of us went to toby's to watch the UFC fight. After about 2 1/2 hours and $200 the manager told us there was a 90 minute limit. The main event was just about to begin and we offered to buy more food so that we could stay. The manager was extremely rude| refused to let us stay and even cursed at us.There were several empty tables so we knew we weren't making other patrons wait.  We were never informed of the 90 minute limit.  The manager clearly doesn't care about his customers. Do yourself a favor and go to a restaurant that will appreciate your business.
1,0,Ridiculous wait time. Chompies desperately needs some new management and oversight. After being seated you wait| and wait....and wait......and wait. Then the sub par food comes out. And you wait....and wait....and wait. You wait so long you regret ever stepping foot into this place. Anything would have been better than spending half your morning in this dump. Anything. The food is below average. The wait times are absolutely ridiculous and the food is slightly over priced. If this is what you look for when grabbing something to eat then Chompies is right up your alley. I will never come back here.
1,0,Service takes forever!!! ------Either you need to be dishing out awesome tips to get attention or need to be a hot piece to get a bartender's attention. Just sayin' ------Live bands and dancing is amazing!
1,3,The little blurb when you select your star pretty much sums it up...Meh. I've experienced better. ------While the place is usually packed at breakfast time| the service is blah and the food is a bit pricey considering it's just IHOP. The healthy choices are limited and like I said...meh....whatever.
3,0,On our way to a stroll around Freedom Park| we realized that we were hungry for lunch.  Armed with a plethora of restaurant.com gift certificates| Quips was a convenient choice.------The first thing you notice is that the place is basically an upscale sandwich shop. (think Subway| Quizno's| et al).  The guy behind the counter was fabulous.  He told us about the menu| and we decided on the roast beef (#1 Clever) and turkey (#2 Witty).------Both were served on ciabatta bread| and both were pretty good.  I guess if I had an issue| it would be in the pricing.  In a world of $5 foot-longs| I'm just not sure if I liked the fare 50-60% more.
3,0,Very good sandwiches| I have tried the turkey on pretzel bread and the roast beef on cibatta.  Good location| easy to get to off of Park  Ave.  There is a free parking deck out back and metered parking on South Blvd.  Outdoor seating is in the shade and the place was very clean and friendly.  Free WiFi is always a plus. Only 4 stars because it is a little pricey; sandwiches are between $7 & $8 and come with either a drink OR chips (other sides available)| so expect to pay $10.  Right now there are specials here on Yelp and also at Restaurant.com.  If I could have given 4 1/2 I would have. I would like to try breakfast but they don't open till 8am and i'm already at work.  Not many people in there when I went and I would like to see the place take off because I really liked it; the sandwiches are that good.
3,0,Food is always good and Mark| the general manager| and his crew are always attentive and courteous. They always have creative lunch specials and yummy homemade desserts too.
3,1,If I could eat at O-Ku for breakfast| lunch| and dinner I would be a very happy person. Oh. My. Goodness... best sushi I've had in Charlotte.------Ambiance and Atmosphere: Very trendy| a little dark| definitely a good date night or girls night out spot------Food: I ordered the spicy tuna crunch roll... delicious! The roll was pretty large and I would have been totally full if I had ordered 2 rolls. I also tried some of the mermaid roll (my friend ordered it) and another spicy tuna variation and both were delicious!------When to go: Mondays and Wednesday from 5:00-7:00pm (I think) are happy hour which includes half-price rolls. I recommend making a reservation if you want to avoid a wait during happy hour. ------Service: Zachary was our service and he was excellent the whole night. He was extremely friendly and checked in regularly to refill water and take more drink orders. ------Parking: They offer free valet parking| but I did not take advantage of this (I should have because the parking lot in Atherton where O-Ku is location does not have a lot of spots nearby). ------I will definitely be back!
3,1,Five stars all around| if u could give more I certainly would. ---First| the Valet guy was extremely nice and not only did he move cars but he held doors open and was funny and polite. ---Second| The ambiance is so nice| loud| and dark| it makes it comfy and a cute place for a date. I would just say| not a recommended child friendly restaurant; just because the place is tight and too loud and fast.---Third| the host was nice and pointed us to the bar right away because the house was full| but the bar did not disappoint. ---Fourth| menu is large and safe to say the mermaid roll was delicious| the seaweed salad was nice sized and yummy and the spicy edamame was addicting| the bar tender also hooked us up with some nice sushi| unfortunately I forgot what it was called.---Last but not least| the service was great| my drink remained full and my seaweed salad took a while to come out and they paid for it while also giving us some great sushi to try. Mark the bartender was extremely helpful| sweet and I would come back just for him! 10/10!! So happy it's in the neighborhood.
3,1,First time and I was not disappointed. Amazing customer service| the food was amazing| fancy but casual; I would absolutely come back no doubt about it! The interior of the place is modern| with bits of nature which ties in all together. Can't wait to go back!
3,1,First of all! $1 Oysters? ---Amazing food quality and overall ambience| the servers were not pushy| extremely attentive| and always showed up at the right moments------We ordered a dozen oysters| the pulpo appetizer| chicken pot pie| and bread pudding to share between two people and could barely stand up by the end of the meal. It was a perfect mixture of gourmet and comfort food and we thought the prices were decent. Personally| would recommand the pulpo and the oysters (they are from PEI)------Will definitely return next time to try the burgers and the braised ribs (as suggested by our waitress)
3,0,Pearl of the Orient in Rocky River is| to me| the best Chinese in Cleveland. I have been eating here since 1992 and I continue to love it! The Yuen Baos (wonton wrappers stuffed with cream cheese| crab and shrimp| then deep fried) are heavenly!! This visit we had the mu shu medley| house noodles| string beans in garlic sauce and orange chicken. All delicious!! The owners| George and Lily| are top notch as well. I love the Pearl. It is often voted one of Cleveland's best Chinese restaurants and I can definitely see why. I can't wait to return.
3,0,Pearl of the orient serves great food. You must try the sushi boxes! I really enjoyed my time| atmosphere made it feel very warm and inviting. ---Ps the owners are super sweet
3,1,FOOD POISONING PROBABLE ---The service was great| but TWICE now the spicy tuna roll was not edible. When I told the server AGAIN the tuna was bad| she asked if I could come in on a Friday because that's when the fish is delivered...apparently they know it's inedible by Monday but still serve it. The owner never came out to address the issue and I was charged for the roll. Very disappointing and I fear for others. The last time I let the server know she still served a gentleman down the bar from me the same roll. Maybe the board of health needs to check into this .---To George: the server said your delivery day is Friday. She's very sweet and I appreciate her honesty. I wanted what I ordered| not a substitute due to the tuna being spoiled.
3,0,Review for sushi only.------Apparently| Pearl of the Orient has been serving sushi for several years. I don't eat much Chinese food (none| really) so I had no knowledge of this until my hair stylist mentioned it one day.------I went in on a Friday evening at 6pm-ish and sat at the bar. I ordered 2 sushi rolls (rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll) and they were prepared and in front of me immediately as the sushi chef wasn't busy. I devoured it like it was my last meal. I ordered a third roll (a Philly roll| I think) and it was in front of me in less than 2 minutes. The bartender| who was very attentive| suggested that it's hit or miss as to whether the sushi chef is really busy or not and whether you get your sushi quickly. ------I had zero complaints about the sushi. It wasn't gigantic| which is neither here nor there for me. I don't think giant pieces of sushi equals quality or deliciousness. My only comment was that the sushi seemed kind of warm and soft and fell apart somewhat easily (as opposed to cool and tightly packed| I guess). ------Now that I'm writing about sushi| I want it| so I'm sure I'll be returning soon. There aren't many (any?) options for sushi in Lakewood/Rocky River so I'll certainly check it out again soon.
3,0,I absolutely love this restaurant for the consistently delicious food. The ambiance is a little "vanilla" and borderline boring but the food and service definitely make up for it. Tonight we ate the spring rolls with homemade peanut sauce and the arugula salad with pumpkin seeds to start. Main course consisted of Ping Gai (my hubbie's fave) and steak frites with blue cheese sauce. An eclectic menu for a wide variety of tastes. This is a "go to" restaurant for us.
3,0,The Queen Mother seems to have been around forever... and given that it's outlasted its namesake (there was a time when it seemed she was immortal)| it's nearly iconic in Toronto.  The Ping Gai is excellent.  It's all I ever have.  I have no idea what the other food is like.  I really don't care.------The cocktails are above average.  Certainly they know how to mix a Manhattan| though I've often found their Gin and Tonics flat and too weak for my tastes.  ------I've been served by the same person the last three visits and she's absolutely charming.  Most attentive and almost seems to care that you enjoy your experience.
3,1,This was a delicious experience. I got the cannelloni| green salad| earl grey tea and banana chocolate cake. My friend got one of their popular chicken dishes with a huge serving of chicken considering the price and quality. Our service was great| although there was constant bickering and tension amongst the staff throughout our meal that made the atmosphere slightly uncomfortable. One of the staff members| who wasn't our server| was pretty rude to us. We think he was the owner| but we're not certain. However| the constant atmosphere provided by the big comfy booths| local art| candles and low lighting made this a good experience. It was a bit of a pain that they didn't have debit| but that seems to be a constant issue in many restaurants these days.
3,0,My wife and I just happen to stumble upon this place and man it was great! Family owned business and they make you feel at home. I had their white rice and beans with the fried plantains| my wife had their chicken. The meat just fell right off the bone. Bring your appetite because the portions are heavy! She loved it! I live in Gilbert and now we're regulars at FrinGos kitchen.
3,0,Maybe because it was NYE but workers were friendly. It's connected to a convenience store that also has a few slots and a gas station too. There's a lot of cars going in and out of the parking lot.------In general I think Jack In The Box is decent but this location was slightly disappointing because the fries were not warm and soft when I received it...they were room temperature and kind of crunchy.
3,1,We know very little about German food...but we do know we really enjoyed our meal last night with friends who are very particular about what they eat...we were not rushed..the server| Kathy H. was very patient in explaining the menu| and the owner stopped by the table to be sure we were satisified...I happily recommend this place..it's casual| friendly and the food is realllly good.
3,1,*** I felt lucky to stumble upon that one. ***------The place was much nicer than the exterior would lead us to believe. The waiter seemed to be a bit uneasy| but was very nice. And I liked the Bollywood songs that were playing ^_^.---The food itself was awesome. Everything was tasty. The sauces with that dry bread| the chicken I had| the rice| the naan| the desert... Oh and the mango juice mixed with yogurt ? Yup| tasty again. ---Nothing seemed  ------It wasn't perfect| but I can definitely say that this experience was way above average for me. Everybody should go there once| see if they like it.
3,0,This local bar started out as just a place to hang out and have a drink with great friends and great staff....now that they have a kitchen and an amazing chef| it is becoming a hot spot and is the best kept secret in Montreal.  Great food| great wine list| their signature cocktails are quite special....everything at Les Incorruptibles is special and deserves to be discovered.
3,0,So I popped in here hoping for a fresh sandwich. I've had a latte here in the past and it stood out as better than any Starbucks or Second Cup could ever hope to achieve. Tonight I had a sandwich| a custard tart and another tasty latte. I sat in the cafe area to write a bit and eat. Can I just tell you: every effing bite was so on point it's ridiculous. The sandwich was perfect| the custard tart divine and the latte..... Every sip hit the spot. This is the best meal I've had out in way longer than I can remember. Everyone is super friendly| too. I just found my new local!
3,0,Just the thought of my last visit on Saturday night with my gf makes my mouth water. Great food| great company and affordable. I don't crave pizza often| but visiting Vincinos reminds why I should!! I think I may order some take out this eve.
3,1,Great little hole in the wall. Food was great but nothing fancy.  Its home cooking at its finest.  If your looking for something exotic and fancy this really isnt the place. Decor is nothing special but the staff and local patrons were very friendly.
3,0,The day I went in there| the guy did not really have too much of a variety.  Maybe he was waiting for stuff from SA.  Regardless| ho hum experience.  Nice owner| though.  Very friendly and polite.
3,0,Cozy place| lovely sushi| friendly stuff and very good value for money. ---I too recommend the Dragon Roll (Tempura shrimp hand roll topping with flying fish roe|  personally prefer with cucumber instead of avocado) and Soft shell Crab Roll they are two of my favorites!---They used to  offer sesame ice cream mochi which is excellent| don't know if they still do that.
3,0,Just found this place and my coworkers and I have officially placed it into our weekly rotation.  The owner is awesome.  He is so passionate about his food and its authenticity.  As soon as we sat down| he brought out homemade chips with 3 different kinds of salsa - including a very spicy habanero (my favorite by far).  He then brought out some kind of soup with lentils and barley| which was great.------The menu is very simple| which is ALWAYS a good sign.  Food was perfect. The atmosphere is so authentic| I kept having to remind myself that I WASN'T in Cancun on vacation.
3,0,Clean| quirky hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant.  Definitely authentic (they serve Menudo on weekends).  Reminds me of those great little Burrito places where you can get a bite to eat at 3am after drinking. ------Oh wait| you can do that here too!  Whoohoo! =)------Carne Asada tacos + rice + refried beans = great alternative to drive-thru after partying all night.  Everything is made to order.  They boast having the bigges burrito in Las Vegas.  The pictures look convincing.
3,0,Great place. Owners are incredibly kind and personable. They have a ps4 if you're into that. And overall good vibes. ------Btw Watermelon and mint is a good combination.
3,0,We walked in with two bottles of wine and the owner's wife greeted us very warmly and told us how smart we were. The food on the menu is very reasonably priced with enough variety. We ordered veal goulash| schnitzel| and cordon bleu| and she recommended the vegetable soup so we got that as well. The owner came over to talk to us and he was very personable and interesting. The food was very delicious and the atmosphere was like being invited to a friend's house. The violin playing by the owner was very good in Roma gypsy style. We will definitely come back when we come back to Montreal.
3,1,Its pretty cheap italian food. $20 bucks for a 3 course meal which is good.  quality..not so much.  There was a romaine heart in my cesar salad which is a no-no...also| got more of the inner| light green part of the romaine.  the cesar dressing was a bit overpowering.  The lasagne was average..nothing outstanding at all.  ------HOWEVER| the service was very good.  Waiter was funny and the staff was all friendly and accomodating.
3,0,Nice atmosphere| courteous waitstaff| and most importantly| very tasty. Price was great| too: two dinners| two appetizers and a soda for under $60. I'd go back in a heartbeat.
3,1,Ate here while staying at the LVH for work. (Dined here twice)------I had a coupon deal for a free Sake with a meal.------Sushi was good| I had the Salmon and Spicy Tuna Rolls. Not bad| server were really friendly and dress in japanese attire.------Place is located in a cool asian atmosphere| dim lighted| bridge| water fall| and koi pond. Plus every hr there is a firecracker light shows with sound that goes off.------I'll be back if i'm ever stay at the LVH again.
3,0,Another classic in Bolton| and perhaps the last of the original Courtyards establishments still running?  Cheeks is burgers| it's what they do best.  Although the menu is full of everything from sandwiches to pastas and meats| it's the burger you want when you come here.  Hand made and high quality they've been doing it the same way since I was a kid.  Bruno and the team are personable and make you feel welcome| and extra credit from me for having the Wellington on tap.
3,0,This is my favorite hungry howie's location. Because of their $5 large 1 topping pizza| it definitely makes it the one with the best deals. They're always friendly when I go in there and if you're a regular they remember you. I recommend this place to anyone in Tempe even if they don't drive to you.
3,0,Was absolutely wonderful. It is a small place but even if you have to wait .... It's well worth it. Their selection of AYCE is way better than a lot of the places around here and you can substitute soybean paper.... The garlic edamame was amazing and every roll was fantastic. I like it because they don't overload the rolls with rice and you can order half rolls!!  Definitely recommended!!!
3,0,Well finally a place that reminds me of my country!!! Street TACOS!!!! Had a family member that lives around the corner from the place that told me and the wifey about it. ---Great place to go eat late at night| made fresh to order right in front of your FACE! We ordered a Carne asada burrito| AWESOME!! Asada Quesadilla HUGE and yummy!! And a couple of Asada and chicken tacos| great taste. ---Only thing is that i wish they had more of a meat variety. But all in all this place ROCKS!!!! ---Going there tonight again with the Wifey for some good ASS tacos!!!!------If you love Authentic Street tacos this place is for you| Go ahead and give it a try!!!---$1 tacos| cant beat that!!------By the way bring cash| dont think they have a credit card machine!| LOL
3,1,First time here last Friday for late drinks and food. We had a reservation for 8| our table wasn't ready (lingering group of people who just wouldn't leave...) but the staff handled it really well. They made a make shift seating area for our group and comped us some drinks while we muched on the pad thai fries. Various wait staff (and manager?) apologized for the delay and our server kept checking in with us. Eventually the group that had overstayed their welcome left and we got our table. I really have to thank the staff for treating us so nicely. Most places would just say "tough luck| it's a Friday". Food was on the spicy side| but there are a few less spicy options.
3,0,I really enjoyed this place. The workers were all friendly and very sociable. We came in around 10pm. Sat down and was looking at the menu. It was very long and printed on computer paper(5+pages and stapled together) so there were a few stains. So many choices we felt lost. So a worker came and sat by us and gave us a few recommendations. ------The food was good but the drinks we ordered were super sweet. I got the peach tea boba. It was probably one of the sweetest boba drinks I ever had. I was only able to drink half. ------Location is great. Right across of CSN.
3,0,I've been going to Laredos ever since I moved to Madison| I call it my favorite restaurant in Madison| pretty big statement huh?  However| I am contemplating this now| I absolutely LOVE the service| maybe cause most of them know my name because I have been their countless times| But lately the prices have gone up and the last time I think I ordered the enchiladas and they were just average| I suggest going for dinner and ordering the steak jalisco| it's usally delicious and they are usually consistent with the food.  I'll have to try it soon to be sure but definitely go to the West Side on Whitney Way| the East Side Laredos is just NOT THE SAME!
3,0,went straight to the bar. food was awesome. the bartender on duty was amazing! his name is matt. even though they were extremely busy| he found time to make jokes and had us laughing practically the entire time. i recommend coming here around brunch time cause the atmosphere is def a good one
3,0,This is a great restaurant to go with your friends. The food is made to order while you watch and is simply delicious (The fresh spices growing at each table) is a nice touch. The open atmosphere makes it a really fun experience and the only reason not to give 5 stars is that it's usually too crowded.
3,0,Very cool place. The owner was super friendly and served our drinks quickly considering he was the only one there.------Cheap decor and furniture| the usual hipster-ish kind of set up I'm seeing a lot of lately.------Great booze selection and love the large menu clearly indicating what you can order and how much it costs. (Some  bars fail miserably at this). I liked the sound of the "whineing pomegranate" drink| although I wasn't up for trying it at 7pm on a Tuesday night. Maybe next time!------Hope the chef gets back from vacation soon so I can return to sample some food.
3,0,Thanx Yelpers for helping me find this place!!---Best oysters ever.  ---Super good crab cakes---The best oysters rockefeller ---The mussels were just "okay"| though---But everything else was SO good and most importantly the oysters in an oyster bar were so good that 5 stars all the way.---Plus| super big bonus for giving me a free bloody mary oyster shooter!!---Really good bloody mary too.
3,0,Great little spot for a fast weekend breakfast or workday lunch. Very friendly| accommodating and eager to please. And the place is spotless.------The menu situation can be confusing. They seem to have more dishes on offer that you would think -- be sure to ask about specials. I'd recommend a specials board that they can change daily in addition to the chalkboard menu behind the counter. ------One little ambience minus: Radio tuned to a Top-40 station is a little intrusive especially when there are commercials. Proprietors should consider hooking up an iPod instead and lowering the volume a little.
3,0,Don't drive or walk to this restaurant. RUN!!!------Why? The food here is so good and  the servings so large| you need to burn off calories before consumption because you certainly won't be able to move after eating.------Enough has been said about the food. It's was TERRIFIC!
3,0,Just your typical Chinese takeout restaurant. Nothing to special. I ordered the General Tso and it was better than most but just average still. The egg roll wasn't burnt like most places so that was good. The price was right for the quality of food and the owner (I'm assuming) was nice. The only thing I would suggest to the owner is to work on the inside decor. There was a supply rack right beside the front register where you order.
3,0,This place is actually really good!------Went here once with my girlfriend awhile back.  We both mistakenly ordered two of the scrambles that were on the specials menu.  We were not impressed at all..  I'm glad we gave it a second chance..------We ordered two items and split them.  ------The first was the French Toast.  It was delicious!  There was nothing simple about this dish.  It is dipped in a banana cream batter.  And topped with fried bananas.  If you don't like bananas| avoid this.  They put the maple syrup on prior to serving| which is fine because it would just make the french toast soggy.  The banana batter helps to keep the french toast from being dry.  ------We also ordered the fried chicken benedict.  This was great as well.  It's a little messy| but every ingredient was good.  I did not see anything spectacular about the fried part of the chicken.  Not much seasoning in the batter.  But the chicken itself was moist and flavorful.  I would prefer other egg options than just scrambled in this dish.------Overall| the food we ordered was great!  And surprisingly| we ate most of these large portions.  The service was also good for us.  ------We will definitely go back to try other dishes!
3,1,Was really looking forward to eating here but left disappointed.   Server| Victor| was great but avoid any scrambled egg combinations.  Sent back twice because they were cold.  On the positive side| biscuits were flaky and delicious and the shredded corned beef  tasty. I will try the famous french toast next time.
3,1,Delicious food| great little place off the 51 (good place to stop off on the way home). I actually ate with the early birds at 5:00pm and so the waitress seemed preoccupied with the regulars (which was fine--I got everything I needed without being constantly pestered with questions and such).------The waitress has a personality to herself---quite funny (and greatly dislikes highways)| and has a bit of an accent but that just shows the authenticity of the place.------For a meal| I had the veggie egg rolls and Mongolian beef---both of which were good (not the greatest but far from the worst). For the price| it's hard to beat.------Highly recommended!!
3,0,After reading the reviews and then stopping by for the seafood po'boy| I can confirm how wonderful this place is. As most reviewers have noted: the food is made to order| which is slow but fresh and worth the wait. Another selling point was the conversation and general friendliness that the owner provided. One last thing; the po'boy was $18 but worth every cent. You could feed 3 people with that monster of a sandwich. If you're in the neighborhood| take the time to stop in. You won't find too many places like this anymore.
3,1,This was the location for a Bridal Shower I attended. The service was great! Our waiter even split the check...what? 25 different ways - that was awesome! The space they put us in was cozy and well lit. My food tasted great! I had their Brie| Marinated Artichoke| and Smoked Salmon (yes| I actually ordered fish!) Bruschetta; each had it's own flavor and textures and I liked them all| although I liked the Brie best.------It was an interesting venue for a Bridal Shower| at times I think our group was a little too loud for the surrounding tables| and when the bride-to-be started opening her gifts...well| it's a family restaurant so I think everyone was a little embarrassed bystanders and invitees/gift-givers alike.------Next time I come I will order an entire meal| this place was great.
3,1,The best sushi in Charlotte| the best I have ever had| and it is not close.------I have been going to NZ Cafe for 5 years or more and it is great every ... single ...time.  I have tried many of the rools| but live the tuna avocado and spicy tuna rolls.  I go with soy paper over seaweed and that's easily done here.  Service is great and prices are CHEAP!  ------I was a giant fan of Ru San in Dilworth for years.  Then Ru San picked up a poor score on the sanitary scale and that was the end of it for me.  NZ is always at "A"| kinda critical for a sushi place (with a C| sushi becomes bait).
3,0,Service was fanatic. This the reason for my two stars.  This place is run by Chinese and the quality of the fish isn't all that great.  I would only recommend if you're looking for deep fried stuff like tempura etc.  I wouldn't come back again personally
3,0,LOVE| LOVE| LOVE this place!  My new healthy obsession in  Summerlin! I found this place by accident a month ago and now I am a weekly regular.  The staff is on the young side| but I have found them to be friendly and helpful when asked.  I really like the Berry Good and the Body Builder. After reading reviews| I am also anxious to try different items.  The decor and atmosphere are clean and welcoming.  You should try this place or you are missing out!
3,0,The food here is pretty good| little pricy. Definitely a guy's place though. Could hardly look at my practically nude waitress| wouldn't bring the kids here.
3,0,Had a philly crepe and a apple cheesecake crepe and we took them to go. We split each of the crepes and shared them and it was a perfect amount (as the crepes are of VERY good size). Delicious!!! Plus the owners are super friendly. I will definitely be going back. It's a gem of a place :)
3,0,Anytime I take friends here they are pleased.  My favorite is their quiche that comes with a side salad.  The seating can get tight but there always ends up being room to sit.
3,0,It's truly amazing this fine restaurant presides in the middle of chaos at Circus Circus.  This is like a diamond in the rough or like an island. Just outside are noisy kids and the proletariat.  Walking in here is such a refreshing experience.  You are treated by a classy waiter who knows how to treat a patron paying big bucks for a great steak.  The steak tastes amazing. It's probably the best I ever had and I eat a lot of steak.  I look forward to coming here again even though it's so hard to park at the circus circus hotel and casino.
3,0,So we have passed by this spot for what seems forever| finally decided to give it a go. Very clean| friendly| and muy Bueno! Had the champurrado just like my nana's! Delicious! Menudo which I very rarely eat any menudo other than my mother's but I had a craving... very good!!! I can't wait to come back tomorrow and try the breakfast!!
3,1,Now| this is my type of place. Edinburgh... you are getting to look all the same. The 'inspired British food' (cough) is no longer cutting it and every new bar that opens up looks a lot like the last new bar that opened up. ------Yellow Bench doesn't. They have promised that there is| indeed| a Yellow Bench to be on display at some point... ------Where else can I get an authentic Polish meal where you know the recipes come from a homemade Polish Mom kitchen. There were amazing weird little salads and perogies and delicious potato pancakes and I was just happy as a clam. ------The best part is... it's not horribly expensive| it feels homey and the food is not 'constructed' it's a MEAL. It's made with love and fresh ingredients and if the waitress had shouted into the back to ask if they had a replacement ingredient... the chef would have come out and given us a random selection of whatever they had because it's small| and it's quaint and it's Polish-ish still. ------Yelp. Sometimes| not often| but sometimes| you fuck places up. Do not ruin this place for me. I will murder you in your sleep (that is a mock threat Yelp Legal Team). ------see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEdXhH97Z7E------This place is adorable and home-like and friendly and delicious and I love it and I want to bring everyone I like here and no one I don't like.
3,1,We have gone here for years. Food tonight was very poor. Service was good. Environment very old and dated. Unfortunately went when it was still light. Server cleaned our table| but it still was sticky.---Food: "signature guacamole" was very small and "blah". Beans tasted as if they were right out of the can| rice was very old and totally cold! Very sad! It used to be very good to excellent.
3,0,Great food and friendly atmosphere. I've been here several times (my office is around the corner) and have never been disappointed. If you're looking for a quick tasty lunch| this is the place. My only gripe is that checkout takes a while during lunch rush.
3,0,Not a single bad word to say. Came for brunch and was told there'd be a short wait - at which point we were given coffee and a tour of the downstairs/learned about the family-style dinners.------Brunch was OUTSTANDING. Seriously| it is not just your average "egg and sweets" type of menu. Each option was unique with flavors and locally sourced. And DOUGHNUT HOLES. An entire menu.------Totally worth the visit. A great neighborhood spot with great service.
3,0,I wanted to try a new place downtown Phoenix and read some reviews and heard nothing but great things. I went on a cloudy night and probably about an hour before they closed. Not knowing what to expect I was asked if I wanted to sit outside or inside. I chose for outside since it was nice and cloudy outside. They had lights strung above the patio tied between the trees and lawn Wooden chairs. I order a darker beer and thought it was great but the waiter said he had a better beer if I loved the one I was drinking and brought me a free sample of another.  I had a great time and loved the open seating outside
3,0,A neat concept nice crust but nothing special. I had their olivani.  Lots on it but a bland pizza with a nice crust. It wasn't bad but it wasn't memorable. It looked great the sauce was nice but it lacked taste impact. Can't say I'd go back. If your a pizza snob this place won't cut it.------We received a reply back made another visit. These people go to the nth degree to make their customers happy. Happy to return second time around pizza was very good. Sauce is great.
3,1,Excellent authentic South Indian food| both for Indians and non-Indians.------It has a good list of North Indian food as well for those who want it| but obviously South Indian food is their specialty!------The restaurant is clean and people are courteous. One common thing I see though is that the staff is slow to respond. I have ended up waiting for around 10 minutes before my order was taken (after I was seated) . I have faced the same problem when I asked for the check as well. However| the food was delivered pretty soon after we ordered it.------Food portions are plenty and it is good value for money| especially the afternoon lunch buffet.------Overall| I would say that this place is excellent and i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try authentic South Indian vegetarian food!
3,0,Lovely place the space is large and nice. The washrooms in the place are good no complain clean nice and good. The food is the best of all the things . kofta kabab was amazing cheap and beat kabab I tried around this area. I have already been here two days in a raw the people working are very friendly and nice.
3,1,This place was excellent! It was very| very busy| but they got us to a table quickly. Our waiter (despite the noise and crowd| there were a lot of people there) was incredible. So attentive and accommodating. Warm and relaxed ambience. Beautifully decorated. It's not cheap but it is reasonable and it's well worth the quality of food and service you receive. Love this place
3,0,I eat here with and without the wife at least once a week. The restaurant is owned and operated by a greek family who is always friendly. The food is fantastic and as authentic as can be! The portions are large and filling. I have never had a bad meal and take my out of town guests here all the time. Every time any of them visits me they always ask to come back here!
3,0,I love Alberto's. Every dish I have had there has been amazing: the caesar salad (especially the dressing) is great| the pizza is fantastic and authentic (the prosciutto pizza is especially tasty)| and the gorgonzola gnocchi might be the best thing I have had at any restaurant. Ever. Also you are always greeted personally by Alberto who is a continual source of great stories. If I lived anywhere close to Cave Creek I would be there every day.
3,0,This is a nice inviting place. The setting is charming and it's a perfect date spot. Although I came here with my buddies| we didn't mind this intimate place one bit. The Pork and Duck Pate is quite amazing. Last time I had a great pate like this was in Paris so I'm glad I found this place which I'll be returning very soon again.  Servers here know their wines. I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means and although we drank beer this evening| our server did a great job in wine pairing recommendations.  If you're into Seafood| try the Santa Barbara Mussels. The sauce is terrific.
3,0,This review is for the grilled cheese only - haven't had the pleasure of buying/eating the many cheeses here. I had the grilled cheese with gouda with walnuts and date jam. The bread was excellent (better than papiqueso IMHO) and the flavors were perfectly balanced between the salty/sweet components of the sandwich. The owner was friendly and helpful. I would definitely come here again.
3,0,I've never been more torn about a review in my life.---I ordered the Margherita pizza and it looked BEAUTIFUL! it's super fresh too| it's just.... ---It needs some seasoning it's kind of bland| also when you pick it up the toppings slide off the pizza.---I bet it will taste perfect once I put it in the oven and eat it later.---Which is kind of sad.---I'll order one more time from here| the delivery guy was nice. ---The $6 delivery charge is bogus though.....
3,0,This place is the best! Their lunch special is very generous and only around $5-6! I have never ordered anything from there that I didn't like and it has become my coworkers and I's favourite lunch place. Lunch special between 11-1pm| it is perfect.
3,0,Good ramen is hard to come by in Phoenix. I heard about this place from one of my coworkers and thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the Republic Ramen| which was pretty decent. Spicy and plenty of stuff in it. The workers were super friendly and I'm excited to try something new next time. I recommend if you like ramen.
3,0,Excellent service and the French toast with berries was literally the best I have ever had.
3,1,The decor if this restaurant is pretty chilled so it's be a good place to hangout with friends or maybe a casual date (if you don't mind showing your eating face along with some sauce on your face) Tried their Mac Daddy which was a hotdog with Mac and cheese on top sprinkled with bacon bits. Tasty| but if the Mac and cheese was hotter then it would have made the hot dog better. ------If you check in on Yelp you get free fries! That was a nice surprise. The waitress was really nice and service speed was decent. ------My friend ordered the katsu dog (large you add 0.99) in total with tips came to about $22. ------Will come back when I'm craving for good quality Hotdogs.
3,0,We stopped here almost by accident and I'm glad we did!  We stopped at the UPS store before heading back to the airport.  We thought maybe we should eat at this pizza place so we don't have to pay through the nose for airport lameness.------I ordered a pre-made slice of some pizza that had tomatoes on it| and I kept saying to myself| "wow| surprisingly this is really good pizza".  Everyone else at the table felt the same.  The atmosphere is clean and nice.  They have a TV playing sports and one of those fancy touch screen soda fountains.  The restroom was way nicer than similar restaurants and actually clean.  The employees were nice too.------We go to Vegas 2 or more times a year on business| and have our normal places to go... we are definitely adding Joe's to our list!
3,0,We had a pleasant experience here! A huge part of that was due in fact to our wonderful server Lisa. She really made us feel comfortable and we certainly enjoyed our meal and time there. I wouldn't expect any less of Mandalay Bay.------Bayside is slightly lower in price but the same vegas buffet staples are still there like crab legs which unfortunately were not warm and split open like other buffets prepare them. A bummer for my husband since he prefers them that way but a huge relief for me- I could ease my stresses of him from digging into this high cholesterol indulgence. ------Note: A wonderful alternative to the busy buffets along the main area of the strip- we were seated right away.
3,0,Two stars for clean and friedly but they'll have to step it up at least a notch. Cold rice (and not lentils & rice either)| Iceberg lettuce salad and altogether pretty mediocre.---Friendly| cheap & clean but also bland and boring.  I hope they get it together
3,1,Come in on a busy Saturday night. Only one bartender | Kimmy| was working. Even though she was spread thin| she gave amazing service. Never let our beers go empty and food was delivered hot. She had a great personality! Everything we ordered was delicious! The beer selection was great and it was fun to try something different! I defiantly recommend this place for somewhere casual but a step up from your usual neighborhood bar.
3,0,I've eaten here twice now... Wow! Good food at a great price. Not only all you can eat sushi but Asian/Hawaiian influenced appetizers and sides. ------Favorites------Chicken katsu---Baked muscles ------I love sushi but not all sushi restaurants are created equal.... Island sushi is close to the top of my long list of sushi places that are in the affordable range.------Happy hour is good if you want a quick snack and don't want to be paying so much. ------All you can eat prices (approx.)---Lunch---$22---Dinner---$26
3,1,I gave this location 4 stars and the Sahara location 5 because of my experience at this one was not as good as it should've been.my fault| not the staff's.------The lovely Esther was a very friendly cashier and the line of 6 people ahead of me was very fast.Food came out very quickly(my usual double double animal style| fries and root beer) and was delish.------the only bad part about the experience was eating indoors.to me| In-N-Out is not a sit-down kinda place.It was meant to be eaten in a car| with music playing and burger juices dripping all over the seat and steering wheel.I'm sorry I had to learn that the hard way....
3,0,The food is great. My favorite is to get the appetizer sampler with 3 different items. The prices are pretty cheap compared to other restaurants in Charlotte.
3,0,I had the best experience at Oreganos! My server was Rose on Friday! We never had a spar moment of wondering where our server was. She defiantly knew what she was doing. She was an expert on the menu. I got the antipasta salad and Rose helped me with what I did and and didn't want she really work with my order! Salad was huge and fantastic! She recommend doing the dressing on the side so I can take the huge salad home. That was a awesome idea! My girlfriend got the pesto penne and love it| it was almost gone! Glasses were always filled  and we got a pizza cookie! Best part of the meal! I will defiantly be going back to Oreganos| and asking for Rose's section.
3,0,We went there last night for dinner. I did a mediterranean tour| Israel and Egypt in the Navy and this food did not taste the same. I guess for Charlotte it is doable. The food didn't taste bad but somethings were different. Maybe the water? I don't know. The service was excellent. The prices were reasonable. The place looked clean. We got there @8pm and had plenty of parking with no wait time for table. I guess I would return if we were in the area but not go out of my way.
3,0,It's time to rewind and dine!!!  I used to hit this place up on a regular basis for the sheer amount of food and drink you can down on the happy hour..  After a short visit back the memories started pouring back just as a clear and heavy as the drinks they dish out!!!!  Any of the appetizers are amazing during the happy hour and the crowds whether they are there or not doesn't even matter because the bartenders are awesome conversationalists.  I LOVE the feel of the restaurant.  Its kind of a dungeon when you first come in with a distinct scent but mehhhh it's damn good once you get down and grubbin'.
3,0,Was a nice authentic Chinese restaurant. Went for lunch and got busy really quick. Was a little confused because they don't seat us. You just sit down and then theyll give you water and menu. Price is good especially with the portion they give  you. People there are fairly nice.
3,0,This place looked mysterious and pretty sketchy from the outside because the windows are covered handmade posters| but I trusted Yelp and I am glad I did.------It is a cozy| intimate place with around 8 tables. The food was delicious without being too sweet| which would explain why the majority of their clientele was Korean. It was pretty full on a Thursday night. There was a couple on a quick dinner date| a married couple enjoying Korean BBQ with some soju| friends drinking their butts off| etc. Super casual| but with a comfortable noise level| and anyone can blend in.------Their menu is as extensive as the other places| so something for everyone.------Server was nice| price is average for the area| and the food was above average. I would go back to this place!
3,0,My buddy and I just ate lunch up at the bar. This was my second time in and this was the way to go.  The food came quickly| the toasted subs were amazing and the beautiful young ladies that were bar tending welcomed us and made us feel right at home.  I'll definitely be back soon to take my seat at the bar.  Thanks!
3,0,Needed a good| quick meal and this place fit the bill perfectly.  I ordered the ribs and fish combo and it was very good!  The person behind the counter was very personable and my meal was ready quickly.  I would definitely recommend|
3,1,Love Donovan's....by far| the best steak in the valley.  And the one time they gave us bad service| I called and spoke to the manager.  They sent me a $150 gift card!  Better yet| I got a call from them the other day| wishing me a happy wedding anniversary.  So thoughtful.   We will always go to donovan's for special occasions!
3,0,They were so nice to us when we picked up food on the way home from the airport (and were late because we made a wrong term).  PF Chang's is comfort food for me.  I always like the orange peel shrimp| the hot and sour soup| and the szechuan asparagus.
3,0,This place has become my go-to burrito place. Don't care that Chipotle is up the street. They make burritos how I like them. They put the stuff I like that others charge extra for. I'm a big boy and I love places where I can get really good food and be stuffed for under 10 bones. Having really nice folks behind the counter doesn't hurt either.
