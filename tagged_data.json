It's a lovely enough space, with farm house style tables for communal dining and a wood fired oven. The menu is concise and easy to understand: pizza, sandwiches, salad and wood fired wings. I tried a salad with their house dressing and wood fired chicken, and a cup of their house soup, which is creamy tomato and roasted red pepper. I enjoyed the soup, but the salad was a disappointing mess. Their house dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette, which was not great tasting and had enough dried herbs in it that they resembled lawn cuttings. The roasted veggies were fine, but the chicken breast was so dry...well, the Sahara is a dewy oasis in comparison to this chicken breast. For the exective chef, if you're reading this...I would rather wait and have you fire up a fresh chicken breast than eat the one your staff cooked off this morning and then rewarmed in the oven. Chicken cooked this way will never, ever be moist and tasty. I know it saves you time and makes things move along more smoothly to do as much prep ahead of time as possible, but this is one area where you might want to not cut corners.

My husband and I split a margherita pizza and got peach gelato from the attached market. The pizza tasted very authentic. Reminded me of our vacation to Rome and Florence.  The gelato was very flavorful as well and tasted of ripe peaches. To comment on the previous posts, there are two t.v.'s at the front of the restaurant which are hooked up to cameras in the kitchen so you can actually watch your meal being prepared. I watched the cook roll out my pizza, add topping and put it in the pizza oven. I also watched as she prepared salads and accepted money. Anytime that food was prepared, she put on a pair of gloves. The only downfall I see is the price of the dishes. Our pizza was $11 for a 10 inch pizza cut into 4 slices. The prices seem to reflect that of a restaurant not a small cafe/cucina.

I would have to try one to see what they're all about.  \n\nMy sandwich was a little salty.  The foccacia wasn't great and I really thought that instead of button mushrooms it should have had portabellas.  The side salad looked nice but I absolutely hated the balsamic dressing.  It was awful and they put it on absolutely everything.  I think it was the olive oil they use that I objected to.  It didn't go with the vinegar or something it just was all off somehow and I really didn't like it.  I also thought it wasn't a great value.  You don't get enough food for the money.\n\nI tried my wife's salad with grilled chicken.  The chicken wasn't edible and she had the same dressing.  The Italian baguette they served with it was a little on the stale side and beside that I saw the lady who handled the money dishing them out on plates.  Don't touch the money and then touch my food please.  \n\nGo check out the nice little market and have a cup of coffee next door.

Needless to say, I love the atmosphere, great decor, bar and a small sushi bar in the back corner.\nWe decided to start with the Dim Sum Platter, a mix of Shrimp Shumai and Pork Dumplings, served with ponzu sauce and sweet chili sauce. Both dumplings were good.\nWe ordered a variety, six, of the specially rolls. All were good, but what I recall from most of them is rice. The two that stood out were the Tuna Roll and Kiwi..yes, Kiwi. I was a little hesitant at first but it was great. The least impressive was the potato roll, one of their most famous. It honestly tasted like McDonalds Hashbrowns, never again.\nI was also disappointed that they ran out of soft shell crab, by 6:30, so one of the rolls we wanted we could not try.\nPrices are high and the drink menu is limited for wines and quite pricey.

I got the obligatory reminder call on Friday afternoon by a pleasant lady which is always a nice touch.\n\nWe showed up and they had free valet parking which is a nice touch since nothing is worse than parking your own car and having to find a spot at a hot, new restaurant where everyone else is.  Walked in to a nicely decorated, well thought out space.  So dark I had to use my cell flashlight for the menu.  Nice music playing and servers were plentiful.  We got a nice hightop near the front door which was a nice table to start but as the restaurants filled up the overflow from the bar with people waiting for seats got a bit annoying as I really could care less about the guy this lady picked up on Tinder but was forced to listen to because she stood right near my table.\n\nOur server was nice, attentive and was good at what he did.  I'm not a drinker so I usually order Iced Tea and come to find out they don't have Iced Tea on the menu.  WTF?  This is an outrage, all \"sushi places\" have Iced Tea.  Besides, this place originated in Charleston SC, the birthplace of Iced Tea and they're in the south for crying out loud.  This must change, now.  Anyway, I sipped on Charlotte's finest tap water instead.  \n\nAppetizer was the O-Ku Spring Roll which I highly recommend.  Nice selection of fish, some wonton crisps for added crunch and an outstanding sesame sauce for dipping.  Well done!  I grade a sushi place by the innovative specialty rolls and frankly O-Ku needs to beef it up, they only have about dozen on the menu and not too many standouts.  We had a Rainbow, Kiwi Kani, and Mermaid.  The Kiwi Kani fit the bill of innovative, and was delicious, the addition of the fresh kiwi made the roll and it was wonderful.  Dare I say one of the best rolls in the Queen City.  I noticed on the menu that they had fresh wasabi, not the green dyed horseradish that most have.  Come to find out they were out.  Here we go again, no Tea and no fresh wasabi?  Our Server suggested the pickled wasabi instead which was different and I must say, excellent.  Added a different dimension to the meal.  We finished with an almond cake or something and it was a nice cap to the meal.\n\nI liked O-Ku.  They're still new but if you're looking for a new \"See and be seen\" place this is it.

This was a really cool take on a fried roll, it had a fried potato 'crust' on the outside and well done fish on the inside. \nMermaid Roll: Tempura fried and the only \"warm\" sushi on our plate, it melted in your mouth. \nSpider Roll: There's torched salmon on the top and that alone makes this roll worth it. Definitely would get again.\nYellowtail Hamachi: Laid on a basil pesto and had a thin slice of serrano pepper on top. This order will change depending on the quality of the fish, but ours...man.

We don't have Twin Peaks in California, so we wanted to try it out.  \n\nOver all, our visit was ehhh, not so great.  The place is more like a sports bar rather than a restaurant.  Lots, and lots of TV's, really noisy, but a good place for a bunch of guys to hang out I guess. \n\nThe service was less than ok.  Our waitress  was not very attentive, didn't seem interested in waiting on us at all.  Maybe because my husband and I came a child, rather than being a group of guys.  There were two tables full of guys less than five feet away from us.  She probably checked on them every five minutes, while we only saw her but two times our whole visit; she took our drink and appetizer order, and brought us our check.  Someone else came and served our food.  She was more interested in visiting with the two groups of guys than actually doing her job.  Or maybe that is job, to only be attentive to the large groups of men entering this establishment, as this place is definitely geared toward \"sex sells\".\n\nAnyway, we were here to have dinner.  We started with an appetizer, which was the pulled pork nachos.  We came with an appetite.  We planned to order dinner, but after the nachos came, there was seriously no need.  The nachos could literally feed five people.  Definitely worth $8.50.  They were really good!  A little different.  I've never had pulled pork in my nachos before.  But good nonetheless.\n\nSo, if you plan to come here, and want good service, make sure the majority of your group is of the adult MALE species.  They won't look at you twice if not.

I will admit that many of the servers are attractive.  However, I wonder if they have little experience serving or just don't like female customers.  I'm a server, so I don't feel bad criticizing.  You're supposed to get the customer to come back and you also want them to tell their friends.  My friend and I did not feel like a priority for the server, she did not spend much time talking with us at all.  For all she knew, we could have money to burn, but because of the service, she gets a crappy tip.\n\nThe second time I went, my girlfriend and I both brought our significant others.  There wasn't that much of a difference.  Once again, we were just grabbing drinks before a movie.  Maybe due to the fact that we weren't ordering food or staying longer, she didn't feel that she needed to put more effort into her service.  If you ask me, that's when I, as a server, spend more time making sure that the customer's visit is a positive one.\n\nThe server spoke very softly and didn't seem confident and lacked personality.  I wonder what qualifications these girls need to get hired....24\" waist and at least a \"C\" cup??\n\nAt a nearby table, we saw a male customer massaging the shoulders of one of the servers, which we thought was highly inappropriate, but the server obviously didn't mind at all.\n\nThere are short video bios of each of the girls on several of their tv's.

I remember coming here a while back during the day time and having a fantasticly huge smoked meat sandwich. Thankfully, one of the best things about Schwartz's is that you can get yourself one of these bad boys at pretty much any time of day. So when I needed my midnight snack I knew I had to come here. \n\nOk first of all I don't even like smoked meat. Except here, of course. Anywhere else I can't do it. So I ordered 2 medium smoked meat sandwiches, 2 turkey sandwiches and 2 half sours. Sadly they were out of half sours so I ordered a regular pickle.Despite there being a line (even at 12AM), the service was polite and efficient. Just a reminder, these guys are cash only, but theres an ATM in the back. For the 4 sandwiches+pickle it came to $36, pricey I guess, but totally worth it. I realized I forgot my cherry coke on the way out which was plain silly.\n\nThe meat was a bit dry. It wasn't moist and delicious like the first time I had it, perhaps because it was at night? Perhaps there was more fat on it the first time? Either way, it was still so huge it was nearly impossible to eat, and the amazing spices were all there so it still tasted great.  The pickle was also great, if you haven't had a pickle that isn't from a jar you bought at the grocery store, you need to. I don't know why they're so much better but they are. The turkey was also exceptionally good, but it was a cold cut, still it was seasoned wonderfully and also nearly impossible to eat like the smoked meat one. Also they threw in a few extra pickles for me! Yay\n\n-1 point for the meat being dry.

I dragged him away from his favorite, Hunan of Solon, this summer because I just couldn't stand living on the East side anymore! So now that I am the Wicked Witch of the West (pun intended) I vowed to find him a place that would do his beloved Mongolian Beef dish justice. Up until this week I was failing miserably. Then one night on the way home from work I suggested we stop at the Pearl of the Orient. I hadn't been there in ages, but I remember my parents always saying good things about the food there. The restaurant is very small, I would guess no more than 15 tables in the joint, but decorated nicely. We were there late on a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty, but I'm not sure I would risk going on a weekend night and having to wait a while for a table to open up. We started off with an order of the braised potstickers and soup. The potstickers themselves were good, but the sauce served with them was very tart and vinegary. I thought it was a little overwhelming and didn't compliment the dish very well. The wonton soup was just OK. Not the best I have ever had and it was only luke warm when served to me. I was a little nervous going into the main course. I was so sure that the Mongolian Beef would once again not meet the expectations of the BF. It was served and he noticed the bean sprouts and carrots right away. \"Not traditional\", he said and I just rolled my eyes and groaned. Here we go again. He took a bite, chewed thoughtfully and said \"but still the best I've had on the West side\". WOO HOO!!!! +1 for me!!!! I ordered the Honey Walnut Chicken and was happy with the large pieces of quality chicken breast, however the sauce was a little too thick and sweet for my liking. But I didn't care because I think we found our new West side \"regular\" Chinese joint! \n\nA few things to mention: \n-On Monday nights they have a special of buy one chicken dish, get one for $1. What a steal! \n-They offer you the choice of white or brown rice - nice to have options \n-The soy sauce they serve is not your normal Kikomans. It has a thicker consistency and is WAY stronger.

We have never said anyting before, but after our last visit a little bit ago something has to be said about the service and atmosphere.  We were coming in for sushi and dinner but the service was so horrible we left after sushi and just skipped dinner.  The atmosphere in this place is like a funeral home and then add on bad service and we have to leave.  You have speakers in the place, friggen use them already.  It is not fun hearing other peoples silverware hit the plates and then dead silence in between.  Create an experience already!  Have you ever wondered why no one stays after they eat for a drink on a friday or saturday night?  Its because its so silent and still.  You cant afford to do this with places like the burntwood so close.  \nOn to the service.  I have no clue how Josh the bartender still has a job.  He must be related to someone.  We ordered 2 hot sakes and when he delivered two large tea cups for us to drink it with I asked him to go get sake cups.  He insisted that they had no more left as it was to busy.  When I asked him to show me one other person in the restaurant using one, he couldnt find one either.  Thank heavens for Sarah, we aksed her 2 seconds later and we had 2 sake cups in 3 minutes.  Josh just didnt feel like getting them.  The horrible service went on for the rest of the evening, and this is the norm as he has been our server more than 3 times, no checking in, asking if we re ok, refilling the water, etc..  The last draw is when we kept trying to get his attention for more water and he was actually sitting on the cooler behind the bar with the tv remote in his hand.  He was changing the channels on the tv behind the bar watching and  laughing at the tv for about 15 minutes.  His side was to the customers and he never looked out once.  Instead of staying and spending more money we left, yet again.  George, wake up, you have a great product but purely miss the details!  People like my wife and I want to come back but you make it hard.  We are young rocky river home owners who want to see you succeed, but times are changing, you must too!

One can recognize the ticket counter in the kitchen-bar.  The theatre/stage itself has been converted to a dining area fixed betwixt the windowed dining area next to the kitchen-bar and a smaller private dining room.\n\nThe decor draws elements from HK-chic and a sort of generic asian-hip.  Black figures prominently in the design motifs as well as matte-brushed metals.  A couple japanese figurines line the walls.\n\nThe owners are HKers and very cool.  George and his wife own this venue and greet guests with dignity.  More than that would invade their privacy, so I will spare any further details.  Suffice it to say, that they're good people.\n\nThe food itself will require a second visit -- I enjoyed the ee-meen, Roast duck, roast chicken, spring rolls and sweet and sour fish.  The style of the meal was banquet style; so I can't really speak to their day to day work.  Today's meal would net a 3.5 to 4 in my book, with the caveat that it was likely cooked in mass quantities; the entire place was packed!\n\nAn update will be in order when next I visit.  At least I can talk to George!", "fast_rank": "0", "value_for_money_rank": "0", "business_id": "gvur69cXFtawJnJbNzFuZQ", "quality_of_service_rank": "0", "cool": 3, "funny": 1, "good_for_meat_rank": "0", "date": "2009-01-24", "useful": 0, "price_rank": "0", "_id": {"$oid": "589f230dcd08b0846debfcc5"}, "type": "review", "review_id": "85KsVvkUGFiBDXo3DrfB7w", "big_dish_rank": "0"}

They need to educate their wait staff on how to properly serve simple dishes like moo shu. This dish, in my nearly 40 years of eating it, is always served on Mandarin pancakes and neatly folded and presented by the wait staff to the customer at the table side. I was offered a choice of pancakes or rice. I declined the rice. The filling and pancakes arrived without a bowl of hoisin sauce. I had to wait about 5 minutes for this to arrive before I could fold my own. Furthermore, my bowl of hot and sour soup was neither hot or sour. I mentioned this to our waiter and he brought me lemons and some pepper oil to season it to my taste. They did \"comp\" us for this bowl on nothing soup. Believe me, bland hot and sour soup just doesn't cut it. To their credit, the menu has many adventurous sounding dishes ranging from various Chinese regions to Thai and Vietnamese. Being from another corner of Cuyahoga county, we don't eat in Rocky River very often. We ate at Pearl of the Orient more than any other such place in that community and recall it to have been much better both in terms of the food and certainly the service.

I ordered 2 sushi rolls (rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll) and they were prepared and in front of me immediately as the sushi chef wasn't busy. I devoured it like it was my last meal. I ordered a third roll (a Philly roll, I think) and it was in front of me in less than 2 minutes. The bartender, who was very attentive, suggested that it's hit or miss as to whether the sushi chef is really busy or not and whether you get your sushi quickly. \n\nI had zero complaints about the sushi. It wasn't gigantic, which is neither here nor there for me. I don't think giant pieces of sushi equals quality or deliciousness. My only comment was that the sushi seemed kind of warm and soft and fell apart somewhat easily (as opposed to cool and tightly packed, I guess). \n\nNow that I'm writing about sushi, I want it, so I'm sure I'll be returning soon.

The cocktail/drinks menu is fun, colorful and quite tasty - my personal favs are the saltwater cowboy (spiced rum, melon liqueur, orange juice & ginger ale) and the Shark Attack (vodka, pink lemonade and grenadine). As for the food, well, I went with a fairly large group and ended up trying a little bit of everything. And lucky us, we got to sit out on their lovely little terrace.\n\nThe jalapeno poppers were the big winner for me in terms of appetizers. The hush puppies were just ok, a teeny tiny bit dry and lacking in seasoning - though serving it with a side of hickory smoke flavored BBQ sauce makes up for the lack of zing.\n\nThe hands down winner is the beef brisket \"chili\". The brisket gets twelve hours with the chef's secret spice rub, twelve hours in the smoker and then at least another day simmering in the richest, smokiest, most flavorful tomato based chili sauce I've ever tasted. A guaranteed foodgasm for even the most jaded palate. The mac and cheese is bold and sharp and topped with chorizo (and who doesn't love chorizo, right?!). The pulled pork is moist and smoky and sweet. The fried chicken is amazingly crisp. The pork ribs fall off the bone and are coated in a deliciously smokey BBQ sauce. Please note, the full portion is humungous - order the half rack unless you plan on sharing or taking leftovers home with you. All of the mains are served with your choice of two sides; my favorites were the jalapeno cornbread and the potato salad but the maquechoux (braised corn, sweet bell peppers, onions & tomatoes) was a top pick with several other guests.\n\nFor dessert we all shared a few slices of the bourbon pecan pie. Served slightly warm, it was a big hit with everyone. Not too sweet, made with plenty of butter, and the crust was unlike anything I've ever had. Less like a pie crust and more like a shortbread cookie. Yum! The portions are generous and the prices are VERY reasonable.\n\nI suggest making a reservation, if only because the food is so good that pretty soon you won't be able to get in without one. Our group had a great time chatting with the staff, the owner, and we even got to meet the chef.

First time here and was not sure what to expect, but since my friend recommended it and he tends to have good taste I went with it.   Newer place not a lot of people then again it was  12:30AM and a few other people did walk-in.  As soon as I sat down the owner/chef came over.  You could tell she is proud of her food and has a passion for what she is doing.  Always a good sign when the person preparing your food has such a passion for what is coming out.    \nWe started with the tartar.  It was a perfect blend of what you would expect at a Thai Restaurant especially since we advised them we liked spicy( I love spicy).  It had a good kick to it, but not so hot that you could not eat it.  Then they brought out the Mussels very delicious and the broth was so good that I continued to drink it especially when they brought some white rice the combo of the flavors from the mussels was pretty amazing!    Next the Soft shell crab which was not my favorite, then again I am not big on soft shell crab.  Next followed the Potak Sea Food Soup which had a lot of flavor and left me wanting more.  The last one was Sirloin with a coconut sauce that was also good.  We finished off with apple crepes and coconut ice cream. \n\nOverall this is a great place with very authentic Thai food and open late for those of us that tend to look for an exceptional place to eat late at night.

I learned from our server that the place is owned by Mike's son, who is also named Mike. \n\nI had the French onion soup and a crab cake sandwich. The soup was good. The atmosphere of a restaurant influences how the food tastes. I'll elaborate: the soup was good, but not as good as French onion I've had at another place recently--the other place had a warmer, cozy environment. Triv's by contrast, had a cold, dull, almost generic feeling. The bowl the soup was in was not visibly affected by the cheese in the soup to the extent that the cheese stuck to it (which would indicate that the soup was not, say, microwaved to cook the cheese over the top of the bowl). I mention this because in a better bowl of French onion soup, the cheese should be and would be charred to the bowl, indicating that it was baked in an oven, as opposed to microwaved. I realize I'm being nit-picky. But it's important. \n\nOn to the crab cake sandwich: it was a grade below so-so. \n\nA note about my friend's meal: she ordered the \"special of the day.\" Unfortunately she reported to me and our server that she could not detect too much that was special about the meal. It was fish--I think walleye, with pasta. The fish was reportedly very plain and the pasta was average--with some parmesan and maybe butter or olive oil.

We were hearing wonderful things about The Commoner and I tried once before to get reservations but was not able to do so. I planned a little further in advance and we got in. Wow! From beginning to end, from decor to staff to food, this place has it all!\nWe got to The Commoner right at our scheduled reservation time. We were greeted promptly by a friendly hostess and were seated immediately. At first me and the hubby were taken aback by how close the tables are but once the food comes out everything and everyone else fades away. The decor is chic, cool, & neat. We loved the aged, faded, wood floors and the steel columns & beams with awesome low lighting that seems to spotlight your food. We were greeted by our friendly waiter who was attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered an app to start: the meat board. It was good but I am not sure we would get it again when we go back. It contained prosciutto, p\u00e2t\u00e9s, duck confit, and, what can best be described as a mouse-like meat blend (yes, I know that does not sound great) but paired with the grilled bread, out of this world! For my entree I got the brick chicken which was served on a bed of garlic roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts covered with a burnt leek pur\u00e9e. We have never, in our lives, had chicken so tender & moist. It was a huge chicken and to have it cooked perfectly-awesome! We loved it. The hubby got the steak frites. He picked the rib eye, again, the meat was cooked perfectly. Although he noted when we go back he is going to get the chicken. His fries were delicious too, well seasoned and a little crispy, terrific! For our dessert our waiter recommended the sticky toffee pudding and me & the hubby both got our own (no way I am sharing if it is that good). Oh my goodness! Heaven! We would stop back just for this. Phenomenal! The steamed date cake was just amazing! And it was topped with toffee sauce and rye vanilla ice cream. I could eat this stuff for days and not get tired of it. Even my drink was good. I got a plum tarragon shrubble, light and sweet!

The other Yelpers aren't kidding when they say this place is great. \n\nPan Asian is tucked away in a strip mall and it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. But it's definitely worth seeking out! The owner wasn't the friendliest which usually stands out in my mind, but the food was so amazing that I quickly forgave and forgot.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very small with limited seating and has a sort of \"fast food\" feel to it (maybe like a step or two up from the atmosphere of a Subway restaurant.) Although, I believe they do offer waiter-service if you choose to eat inside. It's also very clean and the kitchen is wide open, which I thought was neat. Overall, it's a perfect lunch-spot but certainly not somewhere you'd take a date.\n\nI ordered my food to-go and went off the menu that's posted on the wall. I ordered the fried calamari, the stir-fried linguine and the crying tiger salad. \n\nThe calamari was very bland and the dipping sauce didn't help it out much at all. But the linguine and the salad made up for it with flying colors! \n\nI ordered the linguine at a spicy-level of 8 which is perfect for me at every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas because I loooove spicy, but Pan Asian does not mess around. An 8 set my mouth on fire, but the dish was still so freaking delicious that I ate it anyway, gulping water in between each bite. I will definitely order it again but probably at a spicy level of 5 or 6 next time.\n\nI ordered the crying tiger salad for my husband (at a spicy level of 3) but it seriously had to be the best salad I've ever had because I couldn't stop stealing bites from him. I don't know how they made the dressing but it's incredible. I truly believe that even people who aren't huge fans of salad (like me) would love this. It's just drenched in flavor. That's the best I can describe it.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in the area.

We met one of the members outside and he offered to do a shout out and song for our friends birthday, it was really nice of them. The service is usually fast and everyone is always friendly. The only complaint is our table was dirty when we got there but as soon as we mentioned it our server wiped it right away. If you want a table close to the stage, get there early!

Definitely nice to know they care about their customers' experience... I think the only negative is that I wish they had some craft beers to go with the awesome food, but that's a pretty minor thing.  Plus their cadillac margaritas are really good, so it more than makes up for it.
